# 6.4.1. Addresses as Operands

### 6.4.1. [Addresses as Operands](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#addresses-as-operands)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#addresses-as-operands "Permalink to this headline")

All the memory instructions take an address operand that specifies the memory location being
accessed. This addressable operand is one of:

`[var]`
:   the name of an addressable variable `var`.

`[reg]`
:   an integer or bit-size type register `reg` containing a byte address.

`[reg+immOff]`
:   a sum of register `reg` containing a byte address plus a constant integer byte offset (signed, 32-bit).

`[var+immOff]`
:   a sum of address of addressable variable `var` containing a byte address plus a constant integer
    byte offset (signed, 32-bit).

`[immAddr]`
:   an immediate absolute byte address (unsigned, 32-bit).

`var[immOff]`
:   an array element as described in [Arrays as Operands](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#arrays-as-operands).

The register containing an address may be declared as a bit-size type or integer type.

The access size of a memory instruction is the total number of bytes accessed in memory. For
example, the access size of `ld.v4.b32` is 16 bytes, while the access size of `atom.f16x2` is 4
bytes.

The address must be naturally aligned to a multiple of the access size. If an address is not
properly aligned, the resulting behavior is undefined. For example, among other things, the access
may proceed by silently masking off low-order address bits to achieve proper rounding, or the
instruction may fault.

The address size may be either 32-bit or 64-bit. 128-bit adresses are not supported. Addresses are
zero-extended to the specified width as needed, and truncated if the register width exceeds the
state space address width for the target architecture.

Address arithmetic is performed using integer arithmetic and logical instructions. Examples include
pointer arithmetic and pointer comparisons. All addresses and address computations are byte-based;
there is no support for C-style pointer arithmetic.

The `mov` instruction can be used to move the address of a variable into a pointer. The address is
an offset in the state space in which the variable is declared. Load and store operations move data
between registers and locations in addressable state spaces. The syntax is similar to that used in
many assembly languages, where scalar variables are simply named and addresses are de-referenced by
enclosing the address expression in square brackets. Address expressions include variable names,
address registers, address register plus byte offset, and immediate address expressions which
evaluate at compile-time to a constant address.

Here are a few examples:

```
.shared .u16 x;
.reg    .u16 r0;
.global .v4 .f32 V;
.reg    .v4 .f32 W;
.const  .s32 tbl[256];
.reg    .b32 p;
.reg    .s32 q;

ld.shared.u16   r0,[x];
ld.global.v4.f32 W, [V];
ld.const.s32    q, [tbl+12];
mov.u32         p, tbl;
```
