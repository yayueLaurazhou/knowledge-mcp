# 6.4.2. Arrays as Operands

### 6.4.2. [Arrays as Operands](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#arrays-as-operands)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#arrays-as-operands "Permalink to this headline")

Arrays of all types can be declared, and the identifier becomes an address constant in the space
where the array is declared. The size of the array is a constant in the program.

Array elements can be accessed using an explicitly calculated byte address, or by indexing into the
array using square-bracket notation. The expression within square brackets is either a constant
integer, a register variable, or a simple *register with constant offset* expression, where the
offset is a constant expression that is either added or subtracted from a register variable. If more
complicated indexing is desired, it must be written as an address calculation prior to use. Examples
are:

```
ld.global.u32  s, a[0];
ld.global.u32  s, a[N-1];
mov.u32        s, a[1];  // move address of a[1] into s
```
