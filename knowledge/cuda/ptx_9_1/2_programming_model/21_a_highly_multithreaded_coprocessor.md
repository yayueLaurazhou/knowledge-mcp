The GPU is a compute device capable of executing a very large number of threads in parallel. It
operates as a coprocessor to the main CPU, or host: In other words, data-parallel, compute-intensive
portions of applications running on the host are off-loaded onto the device.

More precisely, a portion of an application that is executed many times, but independently on
different data, can be isolated into a kernel function that is executed on the GPU as many different
threads. To that effect, such a function is compiled to the PTX instruction set and the resulting
kernel is translated at install time to the target GPU instruction set.
