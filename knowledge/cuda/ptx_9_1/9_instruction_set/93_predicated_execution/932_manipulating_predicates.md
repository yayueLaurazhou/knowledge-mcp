# 9.3.2. Manipulating Predicates

### 9.3.2. [Manipulating Predicates](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#manipulating-predicates)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#manipulating-predicates "Permalink to this headline")

Predicate values may be computed and manipulated using the following instructions: `and`, `or`,
`xor`, `not`, and `mov`.

There is no direct conversion between predicates and integer values, and no direct way to load or
store predicate register values. However, `setp` can be used to generate a predicate from an
integer, and the predicate-based select (`selp`) instruction can be used to generate an integer
value based on the value of a predicate; for example:

```
selp.u32 %r1,1,0,%p;    // convert predicate to 32-bit value
```
