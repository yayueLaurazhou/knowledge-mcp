# 9.7.12.4. Control Flow Instructions: brx.idx

#### 9.7.12.4. [Control Flow Instructions: `brx.idx`](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#control-flow-instructions-brx-idx)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#control-flow-instructions-brx-idx "Permalink to this headline")

`brx.idx`

Branch to a label indexed from a list of potential branch targets.

Syntax

```
@p    brx.idx{.uni} index, tlist;
      brx.idx{.uni} index, tlist;
```

Description

Index into a list of possible destination labels, and continue execution from the chosen
label. Conditional branches are specified by using a guard predicate.

`brx.idx.uni` guarantees that the branch is non-divergent, i.e. all active threads in a warp that
are currently executing this instruction have identical values for the guard predicate and the
`index` argument.

The `index` operand is a `.u32` register. The `tlist` operand must be the label of a
`.branchtargets` directive. It is accessed as a zero-based sequence using `index`. Behaviour is
undefined if the value of `index` is greater than or equal to the length of `tlist`.

The `.branchtargets` directive must be defined in the local function scope before it is used. It
must refer to labels within the current function.

Semantics

```
if (p) {
    if (index < length(tlist)) {
      pc = tlist[index];
    } else {
      pc = undefined;
    }
}
