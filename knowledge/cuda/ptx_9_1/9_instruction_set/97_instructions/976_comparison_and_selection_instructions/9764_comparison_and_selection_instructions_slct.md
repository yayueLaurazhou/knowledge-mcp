# 9.7.6.4. Comparison and Selection Instructions: slct

#### 9.7.6.4. [Comparison and Selection Instructions: `slct`](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#comparison-and-selection-instructions-slct)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#comparison-and-selection-instructions-slct "Permalink to this headline")

`slct`

Select one source operand, based on the sign of the third operand.

Syntax

```
slct.dtype.s32        d, a, b, c;
slct{.ftz}.dtype.f32  d, a, b, c;

.dtype = { .b16, .b32, .b64,
           .u16, .u32, .u64,
           .s16, .s32, .s64,
                 .f32, .f64 };
```

Description

Conditional selection. If `c` >= 0, `a` is stored in `d`, otherwise `b` is stored in
`d`. Operands `d`, `a`, and `b` are treated as a bitsize type of the same width as the first
instruction type; operand `c` must match the second instruction type (`.s32` or `.f32`). The
selected input is copied to the output without modification.

Semantics

```
d = (c >= 0) ? a : b;
```

Floating Point Notes

For `.f32` comparisons, negative zero equals zero.

Subnormal numbers:

`sm_20+`
:   By default, subnormal numbers are supported.

    `slct.ftz.dtype.f32` flushes subnormal values of operand `c` to sign-preserving zero, and
    operand `a` is selected.

`sm_1x`
:   `slct.dtype.f32` flushes subnormal values of operand `c` to sign-preserving zero, and operand
    `a` is selected.

Modifier `.ftz` applies only to `.f32` comparisons.

If operand `c` is `NaN`, the comparison is ordered and operand `b` is selected.

PTX ISA Notes

Introduced in PTX ISA version 1.0.

Target ISA Notes

`slct.f64` requires `sm_13` or higher.

Examples

```
slct.u32.s32  x, y, z, val;
slct.ftz.u64.f32  A, B, C, fval;
```
