# 9.7.6. Comparison and Selection Instructions

### 9.7.6. [Comparison and Selection Instructions](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#comparison-and-selection-instructions)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#comparison-and-selection-instructions "Permalink to this headline")

The comparison select instructions are:

* `set`
* `setp`
* `selp`
* `slct`

As with single-precision floating-point instructions, the `set`, `setp`, and `slct`
instructions support subnormal numbers for `sm_20` and higher targets and flush single-precision
subnormal inputs to sign-preserving zero for `sm_1x` targets. The optional `.ftz` modifier
provides backward compatibility with `sm_1x` targets by flushing subnormal inputs and results to
sign-preserving zero regardless of the target architecture.
