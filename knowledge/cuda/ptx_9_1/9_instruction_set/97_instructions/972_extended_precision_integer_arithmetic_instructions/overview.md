# 9.7.2. Extended-Precision Integer Arithmetic Instructions

### 9.7.2. [Extended-Precision Integer Arithmetic Instructions](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#extended-precision-integer-arithmetic-instructions)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#extended-precision-integer-arithmetic-instructions "Permalink to this headline")

Instructions `add.cc`, `addc`, `sub.cc`, `subc`, `mad.cc` and `madc` reference an
implicitly specified condition code register (`CC`) having a single carry flag bit (`CC.CF`)
holding carry-in/carry-out or borrow-in/borrow-out. These instructions support extended-precision
integer addition, subtraction, and multiplication. No other instructions access the condition code,
and there is no support for setting, clearing, or testing the condition code. The condition code
register is not preserved across calls and is mainly intended for use in straight-line code
sequences for computing extended-precision integer addition, subtraction, and multiplication.

The extended-precision arithmetic instructions are:

* `add.cc`, `addc`
* `sub.cc`, `subc`
* `mad.cc`, `madc`
