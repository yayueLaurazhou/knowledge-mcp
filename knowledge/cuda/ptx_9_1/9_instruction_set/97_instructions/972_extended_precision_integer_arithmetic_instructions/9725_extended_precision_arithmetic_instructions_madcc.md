# 9.7.2.5. Extended-Precision Arithmetic Instructions: mad.cc

#### 9.7.2.5. [Extended-Precision Arithmetic Instructions: `mad.cc`](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#extended-precision-arithmetic-instructions-mad-cc)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#extended-precision-arithmetic-instructions-mad-cc "Permalink to this headline")

`mad.cc`

Multiply two values, extract high or low half of result, and add a third value with carry-out.

Syntax

```
mad{.hi,.lo}.cc.type  d, a, b, c;

.type = { .u32, .s32, .u64, .s64 };
```

Description

Multiplies two values, extracts either the high or low part of the result, and adds a third
value. Writes the result to the destination register and the carry-out from the addition into the
condition code register.

Semantics

```
t = a * b;
d = t<63..32> + c;    // for .hi variant
d = t<31..0> + c;     // for .lo variant
```

Copy to clipboard

carry-out from addition is written to `CC.CF`

Notes

Generally used in combination with `madc` and `addc` to implement extended-precision multi-word
multiplication. See `madc` for an example.

PTX ISA Notes

32-bit `mad.cc` introduced in PTX ISA version 3.0.

64-bit `mad.cc` introduced in PTX ISA version 4.3.

Target ISA Notes

Requires target `sm_20` or higher.

Examples

```
@p  mad.lo.cc.u32 d,a,b,c;
    mad.lo.cc.u32 r,p,q,r;
