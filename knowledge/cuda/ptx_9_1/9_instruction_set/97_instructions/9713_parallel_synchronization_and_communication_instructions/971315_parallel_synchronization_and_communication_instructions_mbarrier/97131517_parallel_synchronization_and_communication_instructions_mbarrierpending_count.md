`mbarrier.pending_count`

Query the pending arrival count from the opaque mbarrier state.

Syntax

```
mbarrier.pending_count.b64 count, state;
```

Description

The pending count can be queried from the opaque mbarrier state using `mbarrier.pending_count`.

The `state` operand is a 64-bit register that must be the result of a prior
`mbarrier.arrive.noComplete` or `mbarrier.arrive_drop.noComplete` instruction. Otherwise, the
behavior is undefined.

The destination register `count` is a 32-bit unsigned integer representing the pending count of
the *mbarrier object* prior to the [arrive-on operation](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#parallel-synchronization-and-communication-instructions-mbarrier-arrive-on) from
which the `state` register was obtained.

PTX ISA Notes

Introduced in PTX ISA version 7.0.

Target ISA Notes

Requires `sm_80` or higher.
