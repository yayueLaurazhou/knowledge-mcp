Description

The `membar` instruction guarantees that prior memory accesses requested by this thread (`ld`,
`st`, `atom` and `red` instructions) are performed at the specified `level`, before later
memory operations requested by this thread following the `membar` instruction. The `level`
qualifier specifies the set of threads that may observe the ordering effect of this operation.

A memory read (e.g., by `ld` or `atom`) has been performed when the value read has been
transmitted from memory and cannot be modified by another thread at the indicated level. A memory
write (e.g., by `st`, `red` or `atom`) has been performed when the value written has become
visible to other threads at the specified level, that is, when the previous value can no longer be
read.

The `fence` instruction establishes an ordering between memory accesses requested by this thread
(`ld`, `st`, `atom` and `red` instructions) as described in the
[Memory Consistency Model](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#memory-consistency-model). The scope qualifier specifies the set of threads that may
observe the ordering effect of this operation.

`fence.acq_rel` is a light-weight fence that is sufficient for memory synchronization in most
programs. Instances of `fence.acq_rel` synchronize when combined with additional memory operations
as described in `acquire` and `release` patterns in the [Memory Consistency Model](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#memory-consistency-model).
If the optional `.sem` qualifier is absent, `.acq_rel`
is assumed by default.

`fence.sc` is a slower fence that can restore *sequential consistency* when used in sufficient
places, at the cost of performance. Instances of `fence.sc` with sufficient scope always
synchronize by forming a total order per scope, determined at runtime. This total order can be
constrained further by other synchronization in the program.

Qualifiers `.op_restrict` and `.sync_restrict` restrict the class of memory operations
for which the `fence` instruction provides the memory ordering guarantees. When `.op_restrict`
is `.mbarrier_init`, the synchronizing effect of the fence only applies to the prior
`mbarrier.init` operations executed by the same thread on *mbarrier objects* in `.shared::cta`
state space. When `.sync_restrict` is `.sync_restrict::shared::cta`, `.sem` must be
`.release`, and the effect of the fence only applies to operations performed on objects in
`.shared::cta` state space. Likewise, when `.sync_restrict` is `.sync_restrict::shared::cluster`,
`.sem` must be `.acquire`, and the effect of the fence only applies to operations performed on
objects in `.shared::cluster` state space. When either `.sync_restrict::shared::cta` or
`.sync_restrict::shared::cluster` is present, the `.scope` must be specified as `.cluster`.

The address operand `addr` and the operand `size` together specify the memory range
`[addr, addr+size-1]` on which the ordering guarantees on the memory accesses across the proxies is to be
provided. The only supported value for the `size` operand is 128, which must be a constant integer literal.
[Generic Addressing](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#generic-addressing) is used unconditionally, and the address specified by
the operand `addr` must fall within the `.global` state space. Otherwise, the behavior is undefined.

On `sm_70` and higher `membar` is a synonym for `fence.sc`1, and the `membar`
levels `cta`, `gl` and `sys` are synonymous with the `fence` scopes `cta`, `gpu` and
`sys` respectively.

`membar.proxy` and `fence.proxy` instructions establish an ordering between memory accesses that
may happen through different *proxies*.

A *uni-directional* proxy ordering from the *from-proxykind* to the *to-proxykind* establishes
ordering between a prior memory access performed via the *from-proxykind* and a subsequent memory access
performed via the *to-proxykind*.

A *bi-directional* proxy ordering between two proxykinds establishes two *uni-directional* proxy orderings
: one from the first proxykind to the second proxykind and the other from the second proxykind to the first
proxykind.

The `.proxykind` qualifier indicates the *bi-directional* proxy ordering that is established between the memory
accesses done between the generic proxy and the proxy specified by `.proxykind`.

Value `.alias` of the `.proxykind` qualifier refers to memory accesses performed using virtually
aliased addresses to the same memory location. Value `.async` of the `.proxykind` qualifier specifies
that the memory ordering is established between the async proxy and the generic proxy. The memory
ordering is limited only to operations performed on objects in the state space specified. If no state space
is specified, then the memory ordering applies on all state spaces.

A `.release` proxy fence can form a release sequence that synchronizes with an acquire
sequence that contains a `.acquire` proxy fence. The `.to_proxykind` and
`.from_proxykind` qualifiers indicate the *uni-directional* proxy ordering that is established.

On `sm_70` and higher, `membar.proxy` is a synonym for `fence.proxy`.

1 The semantics of `fence.sc` introduced with `sm_70` is a superset of the semantics of
`membar` and the two are compatible; when executing on `sm_70` or later architectures,
`membar` acquires the full semantics of `fence.sc`.
