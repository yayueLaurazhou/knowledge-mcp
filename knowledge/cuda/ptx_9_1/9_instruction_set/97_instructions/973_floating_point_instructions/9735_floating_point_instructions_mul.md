# 9.7.3.5. Floating Point Instructions: mul

#### 9.7.3.5. [Floating Point Instructions: `mul`](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#floating-point-instructions-mul)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#floating-point-instructions-mul "Permalink to this headline")

`mul`

Multiply two values.

Syntax

```
mul{.rnd}{.ftz}{.sat}.f32  d, a, b;
mul{.rnd}{.ftz}.f32x2      d, a, b;
mul{.rnd}.f64              d, a, b;

.rnd = { .rn, .rz, .rm, .rp };
```

Description

Compute the product of two values.

For `.f32x2` instruction type, forms input vectors of single precision (`.f32`) values
from source operands. Single precision (`.f32`) operands are then multiplied in parallel
to produce `.f32x2` result in destination.

For `.f32x2` instruction type, operands `d`, `a` and `b` have `.b64` type.

Semantics

```
if (type == f32 || type == f64) {
    d = a * b;
} else if (type == f32x2) {
    fA[0] = a[0:31];
    fA[1] = a[32:63];
    fB[0] = b[0:31];
    fB[1] = b[32:63];
    for (i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
        d[i] = fA[i] * fB[i];
    }
}

Notes

For floating-point multiplication, all operands must be the same size.

Rounding modifiers:

`.rn`
:   mantissa LSB rounds to nearest even

`.rz`
:   mantissa LSB rounds towards zero

`.rm`
:   mantissa LSB rounds towards negative infinity

`.rp`
:   mantissa LSB rounds towards positive infinity

The default value of rounding modifier is `.rn`. Note that a `mul` instruction with an explicit
rounding modifier is treated conservatively by the code optimizer. A `mul` instruction with no
rounding modifier defaults to round-to-nearest-even and may be optimized aggressively by the code
optimizer. In particular, `mul/add` and `mul/sub` sequences with no rounding modifiers may be
optimized to use fused-multiply-add instructions on the target device.

Subnormal numbers:

`sm_20+`
:   By default, subnormal numbers are supported.

    `mul.ftz.f32`, `mul.ftz.f32x2` flushes subnormal inputs and results to sign-preserving zero.

`sm_1x`
:   `mul.f64` supports subnormal numbers.

    `mul.f32` flushes subnormal inputs and results to sign-preserving zero.

Saturation modifier:

`mul.sat.f32` clamps the result to [0.0, 1.0]. `NaN` results are flushed to `+0.0f`.

PTX ISA Notes

Introduced in PTX ISA version 1.0.

`mul.f32x2` introduced in PTX ISA version 8.6.

Target ISA Notes

`mul.f32` supported on all target architectures.

`mul.f64` requires `sm_13` or higher.

Rounding modifiers have the following target requirements:

`.rn`, `.rz`
:   available for all targets

`.rm`, `.rp`
:   for `mul.f64`, requires `sm_13` or higher.

    for `mul.f32`, requires `sm_20` or higher.

`mul.f32x2` requires `sm_100` or higher.

Examples

```
mul.ftz.f32 circumf,radius,pi  // a single-precision multiply
```
