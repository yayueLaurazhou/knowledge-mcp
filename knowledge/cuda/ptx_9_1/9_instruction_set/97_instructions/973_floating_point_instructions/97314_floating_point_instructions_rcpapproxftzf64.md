`rcp.approx.ftz.f64`

Compute a fast, gross approximation to the reciprocal of a value.

rcp.approx.ftz.f64  d, a;
```

Description

Compute a fast, gross approximation to the reciprocal as follows:

1. extract the most-significant 32 bits of `.f64` operand `a` in 1.11.20 IEEE floating-point
   format (i.e., ignore the least-significant 32 bits of `a`),
2. compute an approximate `.f64` reciprocal of this value using the most-significant 20 bits of
   the mantissa of operand `a`,
3. place the resulting 32-bits in 1.11.20 IEEE floating-point format in the most-significant 32-bits
   of destination `d`,and
4. zero the least significant 32 mantissa bits of `.f64` destination `d`.

Semantics

```
tmp = a[63:32]; // upper word of a, 1.11.20 format
d[63:32] = 1.0 / tmp;
d[31:0] = 0x00000000;

Notes

`rcp.approx.ftz.f64` implements a fast, gross approximation to reciprocal.

| Input a[63:32] | Result d[63:32] |
| --- | --- |
| -Inf | -0.0 |
| -subnormal | -Inf |
| -0.0 | -Inf |
| +0.0 | +Inf |
| +subnormal | +Inf |
| +Inf | +0.0 |
| NaN | NaN |

Input `NaN`s map to a canonical `NaN` with encoding `0x7fffffff00000000`.

Subnormal inputs and results are flushed to sign-preserving zero.
