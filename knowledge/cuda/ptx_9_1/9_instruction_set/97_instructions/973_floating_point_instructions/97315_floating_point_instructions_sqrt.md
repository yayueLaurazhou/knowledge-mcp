# 9.7.3.15. Floating Point Instructions: sqrt

#### 9.7.3.15. [Floating Point Instructions: `sqrt`](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#floating-point-instructions-sqrt)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#floating-point-instructions-sqrt "Permalink to this headline")

`sqrt`

Take the square root of a value.

Syntax

```
sqrt.approx{.ftz}.f32  d, a; // fast, approximate square root
sqrt.rnd{.ftz}.f32     d, a; // IEEE 754 compliant rounding
sqrt.rnd.f64           d, a; // IEEE 754 compliant rounding

.rnd = { .rn, .rz, .rm, .rp };
```

Description

Compute sqrt(`a`) and store the result in `d`.

Semantics

```
d = sqrt(a);
```

Notes

`sqrt.approx.f32` implements a fast approximation to square root.
The maximum relative error over the entire positive finite floating-point
range is 2-23.

For various corner-case inputs, results of `sqrt` instruction are shown
in below table:

| Input | Result |
| --- | --- |
| -Inf | NaN |
| -normal | NaN |
| -0.0 | -0.0 |
| +0.0 | +0.0 |
| +Inf | +Inf |
| NaN | NaN |

Square root with IEEE 754 compliant rounding:

Rounding modifiers (no default):

`.rn`
:   mantissa LSB rounds to nearest even

`.rz`
:   mantissa LSB rounds towards zero

`.rm`
:   mantissa LSB rounds towards negative infinity

`.rp`
:   mantissa LSB rounds towards positive infinity

Subnormal numbers:

`sm_20+`
:   By default, subnormal numbers are supported.

    `sqrt.ftz.f32` flushes subnormal inputs and results to sign-preserving zero.

`sm_1x`
:   `sqrt.f64` supports subnormal numbers.

    `sqrt.f32` flushes subnormal inputs and results to sign-preserving zero.

PTX ISA Notes

`sqrt.f32` and `sqrt.f64` introduced in PTX ISA version 1.0. `sqrt.rn.f64` and explicit
modifiers `.approx` and `.ftz` were introduced in PTX ISA version 1.4. General rounding
modifiers were added in PTX ISA version 2.0.

For PTX ISA version 1.4 and later, one of `.approx` or `.rnd` is required.

For PTX ISA versions 1.0 through 1.3, `sqrt.f32` defaults to `sqrt.approx.ftz.f32`, and
`sqrt.f64` defaults to `sqrt.rn.f64`.

Target ISA Notes

`sqrt.approx.f32` supported on all target architectures.

`sqrt.rnd.f32` requires `sm_20` or higher.

`sqrt.rn.f64` requires `sm_13` or higher, or `.target map_f64_to_f32`.

`sqrt.{rz,rm,rp}.f64` requires `sm_20` or higher.

Examples

```
sqrt.approx.ftz.f32  r,x;
sqrt.rn.ftz.f32      r,x;
sqrt.rn.f64          r,x;
```
