# 9.7.3.21. Floating Point Instructions: ex2

#### 9.7.3.21. [Floating Point Instructions: `ex2`](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#floating-point-instructions-ex2)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#floating-point-instructions-ex2 "Permalink to this headline")

`ex2`

Find the base-2 exponential of a value.

Syntax

```
ex2.approx{.ftz}.f32  d, a;
```

Copy to clipboard

Description

Raise 2 to the power `a`.

Semantics

```
d = 2 ^ a;
```

Notes

`ex2.approx.f32` implements a fast approximation to 2a.

| Input | Result |
| --- | --- |
| -Inf | +0.0 |
| -0.0 | +1.0 |
| +0.0 | +1.0 |
| +Inf | +Inf |
| NaN | NaN |

The maximum ulp error is 2 ulp from correctly rounded result across the
full range of inputs.

Subnormal numbers:

`sm_20+`
:   By default, subnormal numbers are supported.

    `ex2.ftz.f32` flushes subnormal inputs and results to sign-preserving zero.

`sm_1x`
:   Subnormal inputs and results to sign-preserving zero.

PTX ISA Notes

`ex2.f32` introduced in PTX ISA version 1.0. Explicit modifiers `.approx` and `.ftz`
introduced in PTX ISA version 1.4.

For PTX ISA version 1.4 and later, the `.approx` modifier is required.

For PTX ISA versions 1.0 through 1.3, `ex2.f32` defaults to `ex2.approx.ftz.f32`.

Target ISA Notes

Supported on all target architectures.

Examples

```
ex2.approx.ftz.f32  xa, a;
```
