# 9.7.3.19. Floating Point Instructions: cos

#### 9.7.3.19. [Floating Point Instructions: `cos`](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#floating-point-instructions-cos)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#floating-point-instructions-cos "Permalink to this headline")

`cos`

Find the cosine of a value.

Syntax

```
cos.approx{.ftz}.f32  d, a;
```

Copy to clipboard

Description

Find the cosine of the angle `a` (in radians).

Semantics

```
d = cos(a);
```

Notes

`cos.approx.f32` implements a fast approximation to cosine.

| Input | Result |
| --- | --- |
| -Inf | NaN |
| -0.0 | +1.0 |
| +0.0 | +1.0 |
| +Inf | NaN |
| NaN | NaN |

The maximum absolute error over input range is as follows:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Range | [-2pi .. 2pi] | [-100pi .. +100pi] |
| Error | 2-20.5 | 2-14.7 |

Outside of the range [-100pi .. +100pi], only best effort
is provided. There are no defined error guarantees.

Subnormal numbers:

`sm_20+`
:   By default, subnormal numbers are supported.

    `cos.ftz.f32` flushes subnormal inputs and results to sign-preserving zero.

`sm_1x`
:   Subnormal inputs and results to sign-preserving zero.

PTX ISA Notes

`cos.f32` introduced in PTX ISA version 1.0. Explicit modifiers `.approx` and `.ftz`
introduced in PTX ISA version 1.4.

For PTX ISA version 1.4 and later, the `.approx` modifier is required.

For PTX ISA versions 1.0 through 1.3, `cos.f32` defaults to `cos.approx.ftz.f32`.

Target ISA Notes

Supported on all target architectures.

Examples

```
cos.approx.ftz.f32  ca, a;
```
