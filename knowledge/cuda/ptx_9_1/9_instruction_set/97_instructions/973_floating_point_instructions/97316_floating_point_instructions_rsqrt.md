# 9.7.3.16. Floating Point Instructions: rsqrt

#### 9.7.3.16. [Floating Point Instructions: `rsqrt`](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#floating-point-instructions-rsqrt)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#floating-point-instructions-rsqrt "Permalink to this headline")

`rsqrt`

Take the reciprocal of the square root of a value.

Syntax

```
rsqrt.approx{.ftz}.f32  d, a;
rsqrt.approx.f64        d, a;
```

Description

Compute `1/sqrt(a)` and store the result in `d`.

Semantics

```
d = 1/sqrt(a);
```

Notes

`rsqrt.approx` implements an approximation to the reciprocal square root.

| Input | Result |
| --- | --- |
| -Inf | NaN |
| -normal | NaN |
| -0.0 | -Inf |
| +0.0 | +Inf |
| +Inf | +0.0 |
| NaN | NaN |

The maximum relative error for `rsqrt.f32` over the entire positive
finite floating-point range is 2-22.9.

Subnormal numbers:

`sm_20+`
:   By default, subnormal numbers are supported.

    `rsqrt.ftz.f32` flushes subnormal inputs and results to sign-preserving zero.

`sm_1x`
:   `rsqrt.f64` supports subnormal numbers.

    `rsqrt.f32` flushes subnormal inputs and results to sign-preserving zero.

Note that `rsqrt.approx.f64` is emulated in software and are relatively slow.

PTX ISA Notes

`rsqrt.f32` and `rsqrt.f64` were introduced in PTX ISA version 1.0. Explicit modifiers
`.approx` and `.ftz` were introduced in PTX ISA version 1.4.

For PTX ISA version 1.4 and later, the `.approx` modifier is required.

For PTX ISA versions 1.0 through 1.3, `rsqrt.f32` defaults to `rsqrt.approx.ftz.f32`, and
`rsqrt.f64` defaults to `rsqrt.approx.f64`.

Target ISA Notes

`rsqrt.f32` supported on all target architectures.

`rsqrt.f64` requires `sm_13` or higher.

Examples

```
rsqrt.approx.ftz.f32  isr, x;
rsqrt.approx.f64      ISR, X;
```
