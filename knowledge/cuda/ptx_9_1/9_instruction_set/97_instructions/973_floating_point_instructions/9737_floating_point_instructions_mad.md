# 9.7.3.7. Floating Point Instructions: mad

#### 9.7.3.7. [Floating Point Instructions: `mad`](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#floating-point-instructions-mad)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#floating-point-instructions-mad "Permalink to this headline")

`mad`

Multiply two values and add a third value.

Syntax

```
mad{.ftz}{.sat}.f32      d, a, b, c;    // .target sm_1x
mad.rnd{.ftz}{.sat}.f32  d, a, b, c;    // .target sm_20
mad.rnd.f64              d, a, b, c;    // .target sm_13 and higher

.rnd = { .rn, .rz, .rm, .rp };
```

Description

Multiplies two values and adds a third, and then writes the resulting value into a destination
register.

Semantics

```
d = a*b + c;
```

Notes

For `.target sm_20` and higher:

* `mad.f32` computes the product of `a` and `b` to infinite precision and then adds `c` to
  this product, again in infinite precision. The resulting value is then rounded to single precision
  using the rounding mode specified by `.rnd`.
* `mad.f64` computes the product of `a` and `b` to infinite precision and then adds `c` to
  this product, again in infinite precision. The resulting value is then rounded to double precision
  using the rounding mode specified by `.rnd`.
* `mad.{f32,f64}` is the same as `fma.{f32,f64}`.

For `.target sm_1x`:

* `mad.f32` computes the product of `a` and `b` at double precision, and then the mantissa is
  truncated to 23 bits, but the exponent is preserved. Note that this is different from computing
  the product with `mul`, where the mantissa can be rounded and the exponent will be clamped. The
  exception for `mad.f32` is when `c = +/-0.0`, `mad.f32` is identical to the result computed
  using separate mul and add instructions. When JIT-compiled for SM 2.0 devices, `mad.f32` is
  implemented as a fused multiply-add (i.e., `fma.rn.ftz.f32`). In this case, `mad.f32` can
  produce slightly different numeric results and backward compatibility is not guaranteed in this
  case.
* `mad.f64` computes the product of `a` and `b` to infinite precision and then adds `c` to
  this product, again in infinite precision. The resulting value is then rounded to double precision
  using the rounding mode specified by `.rnd`. Unlike `mad.f32`, the treatment of subnormal
  inputs and output follows IEEE 754 standard.
* `mad.f64` is the same as `fma.f64`.

Rounding modifiers (no default):

`.rn`
:   mantissa LSB rounds to nearest even

`.rz`
:   mantissa LSB rounds towards zero

`.rm`
:   mantissa LSB rounds towards negative infinity

`.rp`
:   mantissa LSB rounds towards positive infinity

Subnormal numbers:

`sm_20+`
:   By default, subnormal numbers are supported.

    `mad.ftz.f32` flushes subnormal inputs and results to sign-preserving zero.

`sm_1x`
:   `mad.f64` supports subnormal numbers.

    `mad.f32` flushes subnormal inputs and results to sign-preserving zero.

Saturation modifier:

`mad.sat.f32` clamps the result to [0.0, 1.0]. `NaN` results are flushed to `+0.0f`.

PTX ISA Notes

Introduced in PTX ISA version 1.0.

In PTX ISA versions 1.4 and later, a rounding modifier is required for `mad.f64`.

Legacy `mad.f64` instructions having no rounding modifier will map to `mad.rn.f64`.

In PTX ISA versions 2.0 and later, a rounding modifier is required for `mad.f32` for `sm_20` and higher targets.

Errata

`mad.f32` requires a rounding modifier for `sm_20` and higher targets. However for PTX ISA
version 3.0 and earlier, ptxas does not enforce this requirement and `mad.f32` silently defaults
to `mad.rn.f32`. For PTX ISA version 3.1, ptxas generates a warning and defaults to
`mad.rn.f32`, and in subsequent releases ptxas will enforce the requirement for PTX ISA version
3.2 and later.

Target ISA Notes

`mad.f32` supported on all target architectures.

`mad.f64` requires `sm_13` or higher.

Rounding modifiers have the following target requirements:

* `.rn`, `.rz`, `.rm`, `.rp` for `mad.f64`, requires `sm_13` or higher.
* `.rn`, `.rz`, `.rm`, `.rp` for `mad.f32`, requires `sm_20` or higher.

Examples

```
@p  mad.f32  d,a,b,c;
```
