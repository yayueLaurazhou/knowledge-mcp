# 9.7.3.20. Floating Point Instructions: lg2

#### 9.7.3.20. [Floating Point Instructions: `lg2`](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#floating-point-instructions-lg2)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#floating-point-instructions-lg2 "Permalink to this headline")

`lg2`

Find the base-2 logarithm of a value.

Syntax

```
lg2.approx{.ftz}.f32  d, a;
```

Copy to clipboard

Description

Determine the log2 of `a`.

Semantics

```
d = log(a) / log(2);
```

Notes

`lg2.approx.f32` implements a fast approximation to log2(a).

| Input | Result |
| --- | --- |
| -Inf | NaN |
| -normal | NaN |
| -0.0 | -Inf |
| +0.0 | -Inf |
| +Inf | +Inf |
| NaN | NaN |

The maximum absolute error is 2-22 when the input operand is in the
range (0.5, 2). For positive finite inputs outside of this interval, maximum
relative error is 2-22.

Subnormal numbers:

`sm_20+`
:   By default, subnormal numbers are supported.

    `lg2.ftz.f32` flushes subnormal inputs and results to sign-preserving zero.

`sm_1x`
:   Subnormal inputs and results to sign-preserving zero.

PTX ISA Notes

`lg2.f32` introduced in PTX ISA version 1.0. Explicit modifiers `.approx` and `.ftz`
introduced in PTX ISA version 1.4.

For PTX ISA version 1.4 and later, the `.approx` modifier is required.

For PTX ISA versions 1.0 through 1.3, `lg2.f32` defaults to `lg2.approx.ftz.f32`.

Target ISA Notes

Supported on all target architectures.

Examples

```
lg2.approx.ftz.f32  la, a;
```
