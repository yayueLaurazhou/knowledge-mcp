`alloca`

Dynamically allocate memory on stack.

Syntax

```
alloca.type  ptr, size{, immAlign};

.type = { .u32, .u64 };

Description

The `alloca` instruction dynamically allocates memory on the stack frame of the current function
and updates the stack pointer accordingly. The returned pointer `ptr` points to local memory and
can be used in the address operand of `ld.local` and `st.local` instructions.

If sufficient memory is unavailable for allocation on the stack, then execution of `alloca` may
result in stack overflow. In such cases, attempting to access the allocated memory with `ptr` will
result in undefined program behavior.

The memory allocated by `alloca` is deallocated in the following ways:

* It is automatically deallocated when the function exits.
* It can be explicitly deallocated using `stacksave` and `stackrestore` instructions:
  `stacksave` can be used to save the value of stack pointer before executing `alloca`, and
  `stackrestore` can be used after `alloca` to restore stack pointer to the original value which
  was previously saved with `stacksave`. Note that accessing deallocated memory after executing
  `stackrestore` results in undefined behavior.

`size` is an unsigned value which specifies the amount of memory in number of bytes to be
allocated on stack. `size = 0` may not lead to a valid memory allocation.

Both `ptr` and `size` have the same type as the instruction type.

`immAlign` is a 32-bit value which specifies the alignment requirement in number of bytes for the
memory allocated by `alloca`. It is an integer constant, must be a power of 2 and must not exceed
2^23. `immAlign` is an optional argument with default value being 8 which is the minimum
guaranteed alignment.

Semantics

```
alloca.type ptr, size, immAlign:

a = max(immAlign, frame_align); // frame_align is the minimum guaranteed alignment

// Allocate size bytes of stack memory with alignment a and update the stack pointer.
// Since the stack grows down, the updated stack pointer contains a lower address.
stackptr = alloc_stack_mem(size, a);

// Return the new value of stack pointer as ptr. Since ptr is the lowest address of the memory
// allocated by alloca, the memory can be accessed using ptr up to (ptr + size of allocated memory).
stacksave ptr;
```

PTX ISA Notes

Introduced in PTX ISA version 7.3.

Target ISA Notes

`alloca` requires `sm_52` or higher.

Examples

```
.reg .u32 ra, stackptr, ptr, size;

stacksave.u32 stackptr;     // Save the current stack pointer
alloca ptr, size, 8;        // Allocate stack memory
st.local.u32 [ptr], ra;     // Use the allocated stack memory
stackrestore.u32 stackptr;  // Deallocate memory by restoring the stack pointer
```
