# 9.7.15.3. Matrix Data-types

#### 9.7.15.3. [Matrix Data-types](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#asynchronous-warpgroup-level-matrix-data-types)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#asynchronous-warpgroup-level-matrix-data-types "Permalink to this headline")

The matrix multiply and accumulate operation is supported separately on integer, floating-point,
sub-byte integer and single bit data-types. All operands must contain the same basic type kind,
i.e., integer or floating-point.

For floating-point matrix multiply and accumulate operation, different matrix operands may have
different precision, as described later.

For integer matrix multiply and accumulate operation, both multiplicand matrices (A and B) must have
elements of the same data-type, e.g. both signed integer or both unsigned integer.

| Data-type | Multiplicands (A or B) | Accumulator (D) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Integer | both `.u8` or both `.s8` | `.s32` |
| Floating Point | `.f16` | `.f16`, `.f32` |
| Alternate floating Point | `.bf16` | `.f32` |
| Alternate floating Point | `.tf32` | `.f32` |
| Alternate floating Point | `.e4m3`, `.e5m2` | `.f16`, `.f32` |
| Single-bit integer | `.b1` | `.s32` |
