Description

Instruction `wgmma.mma_async` issues a `MxNxK` matrix multiply and accumulate operation, `D =
A*B+D`, where the A matrix is `MxK`, the B matrix is `KxN`, and the D matrix is `MxN`.

The operation of the form `D = A*B` is issued when the input predicate argument `scale-d` is
false.

`wgmma.fence` instruction must be used to fence the register accesses of `wgmma.mma_async`
instruction from their prior accesses. Otherwise, the behavior is undefined.

`wgmma.commit_group` and `wgmma.wait_group` operations must be used to wait for the completion
of the asynchronous matrix multiply and accumulate operations before the results are accessed.

Register operand `d` represents the accumulator matrix as well as the destination matrix,
distributed across the participating threads. Register operand `a` represents the multiplicand
matrix A in register distributed across the participating threads. The 64-bit register operands
`a-desc` and `b-desc` are the matrix descriptors which represent the multiplicand matrices A and
B in shared memory respectively. The contents of a matrix descriptor must be same across all the warps
in the warpgroup. The format of the matrix descriptor is described in
[Matrix Descriptor Format](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#asynchronous-warpgroup-level-matrix-shared-memory-layout-matrix-descriptor).

Matrices A and B are stored in row-major and column-major format respectively. For certain floating
point variants, the input matrices A and B can be transposed by specifying the value 1 for the
immediate integer arguments `imm-trans-a` and `imm-trans-b` respectively. A value of 0 can be
used to avoid the transpose operation. The valid values of `imm-trans-a` and `imm-trans-b` are 0
and 1. The transpose operation is only supported for the `wgmma.mma_async` variants with `.f16`/
`.bf16` types on matrices accessed from shared memory using matrix descriptors.

For the floating point variants of the `wgmma.mma_async` operation, each element of the input
matrices A and B can be negated by specifying the value -1 for operands `imm-scale-a` and
`imm-scale-b` respectively. A value of 1 can be used to avoid the negate operation. The valid
values of `imm-scale-a` and `imm-scale-b` are -1 and 1.

The qualifiers `.dtype`, `.atype` and `.btype` indicate the data type of the elements in
matrices D, A and B respectively. `.atype` and `.btype` must be the same for all floating point
`wgmma.mma_async` variants except for the FP8 floating point variants. The sizes of individual
data elements of matrices A and B in alternate floating point variants of the `wgmma.mma_async`
operation are as follows:

* Matrices A and B have 8-bit data elements when `.atype`/ `.btype` is `.e4m3`/`.e5m2`.
* Matrices A and B have 16-bit data elements when `.atype`/ `.btype` is `.bf16`.
* Matrices A and B have 32-bit data elements when `.atype`/ `.btype` is `.tf32`.

Precision and rounding:

* Floating point operations:

  Element-wise multiplication of matrix A and B is performed with at least single precision. When
  `.dtype` is `.f32`, accumulation of the intermediate values is performed with at least single
  precision. When `.dtype` is `.f16`, the accumulation is performed with at least half
  precision.

  The accumulation order, rounding and handling of subnormal inputs are unspecified.
* `.bf16` and `.tf32` floating point operations:

  Element-wise multiplication of matrix A and B is performed with specified
  precision. `wgmma.mma_async` operation involving type `.tf32` will truncate lower 13 bits of
  the 32-bit input data before multiplication is issued. Accumulation of the intermediate values is
  performed with at least single precision.

  The accumulation order, rounding, and handling of subnormal inputs are unspecified.
* Integer operations:

  The integer `wgmma.mma_async` operation is performed with `.s32` accumulators. The
  `.satfinite` qualifier indicates that on overflow, the accumulated value is limited to the
  range *MIN\_INT32*.. *MAX\_INT32* (where the bounds are defined as the minimum negative signed
  32-bit integer and the maximum positive signed 32-bit integer respectively).

  If `.satfinite` is not specified, the accumulated value is wrapped instead.

The mandatory `.sync` qualifier indicates that `wgmma.mma_async` instruction causes the
executing thread to wait until all threads in the warp execute the same `wgmma.mma_async`
instruction before resuming execution.

The mandatory `.aligned` qualifier indicates that all threads in the warpgroup must execute the
same `wgmma.mma_async` instruction. In conditionally executed code, a `wgmma.mma_async`
instruction should only be used if it is known that all threads in the warpgroup evaluate the
condition identically, otherwise behavior is undefined.

PTX ISA Notes
