##### 9.7.15.7.2. [Asynchronous Multiply-and-Accumulate Instruction: `wgmma.commit_group`](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#asynchronous-warpgroup-level-matrix-instructions-wgmma-commit-group)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#asynchronous-warpgroup-level-matrix-instructions-wgmma-commit-group "Permalink to this headline")

`wgmma.commit_group`

Commits all prior uncommitted `wgmma.mma_async` operations into a *wgmma-group*.

Syntax

```
wgmma.commit_group.sync.aligned;

Description

`wgmma.commit_group` instruction creates a new wgmma-group per warpgroup and batches all prior
`wgmma.mma_async` instructions initiated by the executing warp but not committed to any
wgmma-group into the new wgmma-group. If there are no uncommitted `wgmma.mma_async` instructions
then `wgmma.commit_group` results in an empty wgmma-group.

An executing thread can wait for the completion of all `wgmma.mma_async` operations in a
wgmma-group by using `wgmma.wait_group`.

The mandatory `.sync` qualifier indicates that `wgmma.commit_group` instruction causes the
executing thread to wait until all threads in the warp execute the same `wgmma.commit_group`
instruction before resuming execution.

The mandatory `.aligned` qualifier indicates that all threads in the warpgroup must execute the
same `wgmma.commit_group` instruction. In conditionally executed code, an `wgmma.commit_group`
instruction should only be used if it is known that all threads in the warpgroup evaluate the
condition identically, otherwise the behavior is undefined.

PTX ISA Notes
