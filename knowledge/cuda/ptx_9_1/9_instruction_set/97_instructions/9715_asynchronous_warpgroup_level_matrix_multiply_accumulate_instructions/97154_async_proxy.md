# 9.7.15.4. Async Proxy

#### 9.7.15.4. [Async Proxy](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#asynchronous-warpgroup-level-matrix-async-proxy)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#asynchronous-warpgroup-level-matrix-async-proxy "Permalink to this headline")

The `wgmma.mma_async` operations are performed in the asynchronous proxy (or async proxy).

Accessing the same memory location across multiple proxies needs a cross-proxy fence. For the async
proxy, `fence.proxy.async` should be used to synchronize memory between generic proxy and the
async proxy.

The completion of a `wgmma.mma_async` operation is followed by an implicit generic-async proxy
fence. So the result of the asynchronous operation is made visible to the generic proxy as soon as
its completion is observed. `wgmma.commit_group` and `wgmma.wait_group` operations must be used
to wait for the completion of the `wgmma.mma_async` instructions.
