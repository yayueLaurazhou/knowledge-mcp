# 9.7.14.4.1. Matrix Fragments for WMMA

##### 9.7.14.4.1. [Matrix Fragments for WMMA](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#warp-level-matrix-fragment)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#warp-level-matrix-fragment "Permalink to this headline")

Each thread in the warp holds a fragment of the matrix. The distribution of fragments loaded by the
threads in a warp is unspecified and is target architecture dependent, and hence the identity of the
fragment within the matrix is also unspecified and is target architecture dependent. The fragment
returned by a `wmma` operation can be used as an operand for another `wmma` operation if the
shape, layout and element type of the underlying matrix matches. Since fragment layout is
architecture dependent, using the fragment returned by a `wmma` operation in one function as an
operand for a `wmma` operation in a different function may not work as expected if the two
functions are linked together but were compiled for different link-compatible SM architectures. Note
passing `wmma` fragment to a function having `.weak` linkage is unsafe since at link time
references to such function may get resolved to a function in different compilation module.

Each fragment is a vector expression whose contents are determined as follows. The identity of
individual matrix elements in the fragment is unspecified.

Manipulating fragment contents

The contents of a matrix fragment can be manipulated by reading and writing to individual
registers in the fragment, provided the following conditions are satisfied:

* All matrix element in the fragment are operated on uniformly across threads, using the same
  parameters.
* The order of the matrix elements is not changed.

For example, if each register corresponding to a given matrix is multiplied by a uniform constant
value, then the resulting matrix is simply the scaled version of the original matrix.

Note that type conversion between `.f16` and `.f32` accumulator fragments is not supported in
either direction. The result is undefined even if the order of elements in the fragment remains
unchanged.
