Description

Collectively store a matrix across all threads in a warp at the location indicated by address
operand `p` in the specified state space from source register `r`.

If no state space is given, perform the memory accesses using
[Generic Addressing](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#generic-addressing). `wmma.load` operation may be used only with `.global` and
`.shared` spaces and with generic addressing, where the address points to `.global` or
`.shared` space.

The source operand `r` is a brace-enclosed vector expression that matches the shape of the
fragment expected by the store operation, as described in [Matrix Fragments for WMMA](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#warp-level-matrix-fragment).

The `.shape` qualifier indicates the dimensions of all the matrix arguments involved in the
intended `wmma` computation. It must match the `.shape` qualifier specified on the `wmma.mma`
instruction that produced the D matrix being stored.

The `.layout` qualifier indicates whether the matrix to be loaded is stored in *row-major* or
*column-major* format.

`stride` is an optional 32-bit integer operand that provides an offset in terms of matrix elements
between the start of consecutive instances of the *leading dimension* (rows or columns). The default
value of `stride` is described in
[Matrix Storage for WMMA](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#warp-level-matrix-storage) and must be specified if the actual value is larger than
the default. For example, if the matrix is a sub-matrix of a larger matrix, then the value of stride
is the leading dimension of the larger matrix. Specifying a value lower than the default value
results in undefined behavior.

The required alignment for address `p` and `stride` is described in the
[Matrix Storage for WMMA](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#warp-level-matrix-storage).

The mandatory `.sync` qualifier indicates that `wmma.store` causes the executing thread to wait
until all threads in the warp execute the same `wmma.store` instruction before resuming execution.

The mandatory `.aligned` qualifier indicates that all threads in the warp must execute the same
`wmma.store` instruction. In conditionally executed code, a `wmma.store` instruction should only
be used if it is known that all threads in the warp evaluate the condition identically, otherwise
behavior is undefined.

The behavior of `wmma.store` is undefined if all threads do not use the same qualifiers and the
same values of `p` and `stride`, or if any thread in the warp has exited.

`wmma.store` is treated as a *weak* memory operation in the [Memory Consistency Model](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#memory-consistency-model).

PTX ISA Notes

Introduced in PTX ISA version 6.0.

`.m8n32k16` and `.m32n8k16` introduced in PTX ISA version 6.1.

Integer, sub-byte integer and single-bit `wmma` introduced in PTX ISA version 6.3.

`.m16n16k8` introduced in PTX ISA version 7.0.

Double precision `wmma` introduced in PTX ISA version 7.0.

Modifier `.aligned` is required from PTX ISA version 6.3 onwards, and considered implicit in PTX
ISA versions less than 6.3.

Support for `::cta` sub-qualifier introduced in PTX ISA version 7.8.

Target ISA Notes

Floating point `wmma` requires `sm_70` or higher.

Integer `wmma` requires `sm_72` or higher.

Sub-byte and single-bit `wmma` requires `sm_75` or higher.

Double precision `wmma` and shape `.m16n16k8` requires `sm_80` or higher.
