# 9.7.8.8. Logic and Shift Instructions: shl

#### 9.7.8.8. [Logic and Shift Instructions: `shl`](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#logic-and-shift-instructions-shl)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#logic-and-shift-instructions-shl "Permalink to this headline")

`shl`

Shift bits left, zero-fill on right.

Syntax

```
shl.type d, a, b;

.type = { .b16, .b32, .b64 };
```

Description

Shift `a` left by the amount specified by unsigned 32-bit value in `b`.

Semantics

```
d = a << b;
```

Copy to clipboard

Notes

Shift amounts greater than the register width *N* are clamped to *N*.

The sizes of the destination and first source operand must match, but not necessarily the type. The
`b` operand must be a 32-bit value, regardless of the instruction type.

PTX ISA Notes

Introduced in PTX ISA version 1.0.

Target ISA Notes

Supported on all target architectures.

Example

```
shl.b32  q,a,2;
```
