# 9.7.8.7. Logic and Shift Instructions: shf

#### 9.7.8.7. [Logic and Shift Instructions: `shf`](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#logic-and-shift-instructions-shf)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#logic-and-shift-instructions-shf "Permalink to this headline")

`shf`

Funnel shift.

Syntax

```
shf.l.mode.b32  d, a, b, c;  // left shift
shf.r.mode.b32  d, a, b, c;  // right shift

.mode = { .clamp, .wrap };
```

Description

Shift the 64-bit value formed by concatenating operands `a` and `b` left or right by the amount
specified by the unsigned 32-bit value in `c`. Operand `b` holds bits `63:32` and operand a
holds bits `31:0` of the 64-bit source value. The source is shifted left or right by the clamped
or wrapped value in `c`. For `shf.l`, the most-significant 32-bits of the result are written
into `d`; for `shf.r`, the least-significant 32-bits of the result are written into `d`.

Semantics

```
u32  n = (.mode == .clamp) ? min(c, 32) : c & 0x1f;
switch (shf.dir) {  // shift concatenation of [b, a]
    case shf.l:     // extract 32 msbs
           u32  d = (b << n)      | (a >> (32-n));
    case shf.r:     // extract 32 lsbs
           u32  d = (b << (32-n)) | (a >> n);
}

Notes

Use funnel shift for multi-word shift operations and for rotate operations. The shift amount is
limited to the range `0..32` in clamp mode and `0..31` in wrap mode, so shifting multi-word
values by distances greater than 32 requires first moving 32-bit words, then using `shf` to shift
the remaining `0..31` distance.

To shift data sizes greater than 64 bits to the right, use repeated `shf.r` instructions applied
to adjacent words, operating from least-significant word towards most-significant word. At each
step, a single word of the shifted result is computed. The most-significant word of the result is
computed using a `shr.{u32,s32}` instruction, which zero or sign fills based on the instruction
type.

To shift data sizes greater than 64 bits to the left, use repeated `shf.l` instructions applied to
adjacent words, operating from most-significant word towards least-significant word. At each step, a
single word of the shifted result is computed. The least-significant word of the result is computed
using a `shl` instruction.

Use funnel shift to perform 32-bit left or right rotate by supplying the same value for source
arguments `a` and `b`.

PTX ISA Notes

Introduced in PTX ISA version 3.1.

Target ISA Notes

Requires `sm_32` or higher.

Example

```
shf.l.clamp.b32  r3,r1,r0,16;

// 128-bit left shift; n < 32
// [r7,r6,r5,r4] = [r3,r2,r1,r0] << n
shf.l.clamp.b32  r7,r2,r3,n;
shf.l.clamp.b32  r6,r1,r2,n;
shf.l.clamp.b32  r5,r0,r1,n;
shl.b32          r4,r0,n;

// 128-bit right shift, arithmetic; n < 32
// [r7,r6,r5,r4] = [r3,r2,r1,r0] >> n
shf.r.clamp.b32  r4,r0,r1,n;
shf.r.clamp.b32  r5,r1,r2,n;
shf.r.clamp.b32  r6,r2,r3,n;
shr.s32          r7,r3,n;     // result is sign-extended

shf.r.clamp.b32  r1,r0,r0,n;  // rotate right by n; n < 32
shf.l.clamp.b32  r1,r0,r0,n;  // rotate left by n; n < 32

// extract 32-bits from [r1,r0] starting at position n < 32
shf.r.clamp.b32  r0,r0,r1,n;
