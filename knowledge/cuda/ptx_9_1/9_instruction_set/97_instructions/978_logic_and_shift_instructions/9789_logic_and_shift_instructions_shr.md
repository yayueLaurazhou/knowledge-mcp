# 9.7.8.9. Logic and Shift Instructions: shr

#### 9.7.8.9. [Logic and Shift Instructions: `shr`](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#logic-and-shift-instructions-shr)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#logic-and-shift-instructions-shr "Permalink to this headline")

`shr`

Shift bits right, sign or zero-fill on left.

Syntax

```
shr.type d, a, b;

.type = { .b16, .b32, .b64,
          .u16, .u32, .u64,
          .s16, .s32, .s64 };
```

Description

Shift `a` right by the amount specified by unsigned 32-bit value in `b`. Signed shifts fill with
the sign bit, unsigned and untyped shifts fill with `0`.

Semantics

```
d = a >> b;
```

Notes

Shift amounts greater than the register width *N* are clamped to *N*.

The sizes of the destination and first source operand must match, but not necessarily the type. The
`b` operand must be a 32-bit value, regardless of the instruction type.

Bit-size types are included for symmetry with `shl`.

PTX ISA Notes

Introduced in PTX ISA version 1.0.

Target ISA Notes

Supported on all target architectures.

Example

```
shr.u16  c,a,2;
shr.s32  i,i,1;
shr.b16  k,i,j;
```
