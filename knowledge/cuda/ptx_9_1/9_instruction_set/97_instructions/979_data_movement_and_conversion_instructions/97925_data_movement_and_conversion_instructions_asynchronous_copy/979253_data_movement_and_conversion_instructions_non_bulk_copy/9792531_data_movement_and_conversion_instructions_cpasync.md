`cp.async`

Initiates an asynchronous copy operation from one state space to another.

Description

`cp.async` is a non-blocking instruction which initiates an asynchronous copy operation of data
from the location specified by source address operand `src` to the location specified by
destination address operand `dst`. Operand `src` specifies a location in the global state space
and `dst` specifies a location in the shared state space.

Operand `cp-size` is an integer constant which specifies the size of data in bytes to be copied to
the destination `dst`. `cp-size` can only be 4, 8 and 16.

Instruction `cp.async` allows optionally specifying a 32-bit integer operand `src-size`. Operand
`src-size` represents the size of the data in bytes to be copied from `src` to `dst` and must
be less than `cp-size`. In such case, remaining bytes in destination `dst` are filled with
zeros. Specifying `src-size` larger than `cp-size` results in undefined behavior.

The optional and non-immediate predicate argument `ignore-src` specifies whether the data from the
source location `src` should be ignored completely. If the source data is ignored then zeros will
be copied to destination `dst`. If the argument `ignore-src` is not specified then it defaults
to `False`.

Supported alignment requirements and addressing modes for operand `src` and `dst` are described
in [Addresses as Operands](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#addresses-as-operands).

The mandatory `.async` qualifier indicates that the `cp` instruction will initiate the memory
copy operation asynchronously and control will return to the executing thread before the copy
operation is complete. The executing thread can then use
[async-group based completion mechanism](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#data-movement-and-conversion-instructions-asynchronous-copy-completion-mechanisms-async-group)
or the [mbarrier based completion mechanism](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#data-movement-and-conversion-instructions-asynchronous-copy-completion-mechanisms-mbarrier)
to wait for completion of the asynchronous copy operation.
No other synchronization mechanism guarantees the completion of the asynchronous
copy operations.

There is no ordering guarantee between two `cp.async` operations if they are not explicitly
synchronized using `cp.async.wait_all` or `cp.async.wait_group` or [mbarrier instructions](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#parallel-synchronization-and-communication-instructions-mbarrier).

As described in [Cache Operators](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#cache-operators), the `.cg` qualifier indicates
caching of data only at global level cache L2 and not at L1 whereas `.ca` qualifier indicates
caching of data at all levels including L1 cache. Cache operator are treated as performance hints
only.

`cp.async` is treated as a weak memory operation in the [Memory Consistency Model](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#memory-consistency-model).

The `.level::prefetch_size` qualifier is a hint to fetch additional data of the specified size
into the respective cache level.The sub-qualifier `prefetch_size` can be set to either of `64B`,
`128B`, `256B` thereby allowing the prefetch size to be 64 Bytes, 128 Bytes or 256 Bytes
respectively.

The qualifier `.level::prefetch_size` may only be used with `.global` state space and with
generic addressing where the address points to `.global` state space. If the generic address does
not fall within the address window of the global memory, then the prefetching behavior is undefined.

The `.level::prefetch_size` qualifier is treated as a performance hint only.

When the optional argument `cache-policy` is specified, the qualifier `.level::cache_hint` is
required. The 64-bit operand `cache-policy` specifies the cache eviction policy that may be used
during the memory access.

The qualifier `.level::cache_hint` is only supported for `.global` state space and for generic
addressing where the address points to the `.global` state space.

`cache-policy` is a hint to the cache subsystem and may not always be respected. It is treated as
a performance hint only, and does not change the memory consistency behavior of the program.
