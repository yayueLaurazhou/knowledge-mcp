Description

`st.async` is a non-blocking instruction which initiates an asynchronous store operation that
stores the value specified by source operand `b` to the destination memory location
specified by operand `a`.

Operands

* `a` is a destination address, and must be either a register, or of the form `register + immOff`,
  as described in [Addresses as Operands](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#addresses-as-operands).
* `b` is a source value, of the type indicated by qualifier `.type`.
* `mbar` is an mbarrier object address.

Qualifiers

* `.mmio` indicates whether this is an [mmio Operation](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#mmio-operation).
* `.sem` specifies the memory ordering semantics as described in the
  [Memory Consistency Model](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#memory-consistency-model).

  + If `.sem` is not specified, it defaults to `.weak`.
* `.scope` specifies the set of threads with which this instruction can directly synchronize.
* `.ss` specifies the state space of the destination operand `a` and the mbarrier
  operand `mbar`.

  + If `.ss` is not specified, [Generic Addressing](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#generic-addressing) is used.
* `.completion_mechanism` specifies the mechanism for observing the completion of the
  asynchronous operation.

  + When `.completion_mechanism` is `.mbarrier::complete_tx::bytes`: upon completion of the
    asynchronous operation, a
    [complete-tx](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#parallel-synchronization-and-communication-instructions-mbarrier-complete-tx-operation)
    operation will be performed on the mbarrier object specified by the operand `mbar`, with
    `completeCount` argument equal to the amount of data stored in bytes.
    This instruction accesses its `mbarrier` operand using generic-proxy.
* `.type` specifies the type of the source operand `b`.

Conditions

When `.sem` is `.weak`:

* This is a weak store to shared memory, which signals its completion through an mbarrier object.
* The store operation is treated as a weak memory operation.
* The complete-tx operation on the mbarrier has `.release` semantics at `.cluster`
  scope.
* Requires:

  + The shared memory addresses of destination operand `a` and the *mbarrier object* `mbar` belong
    to the same CTA within the same cluster as the executing thread.
  + The number of CTAs within the cluster is strictly greater than one; `%cluster_nctarank > 1` is true.

  Otherwise, the behavior is undefined.
* `.mmio` must not be specified.
* If `.ss` is specified, it must be `.shared::cluster`.
* If `.ss` is not specified, generic addressing is used for operands `a` and `mbar`.
  If the generic addresses specified do not fall within the address window of
  `.shared::cluster` state space, the behavior is undefined.
* `.completion_mechanism` must be specified and must be `.mbarrier::complete_tx::bytes`.

When `.sem` is `.release`:

* This is a release store to global memory.
* The store operation is a strong memory operation with `.release` semantics at the
  scope specified by `.scope`.
* If `.mmio` is specified, `.scope` must be `.sys`.
* If `.ss` is specified, it must be `.global`.
* If `.ss` is not specified, generic addressing is used for operand `a`.
  If the generic address specified does not fall within the address window of `.global`
  state space, the behavior is undefined.

PTX ISA Notes

Introduced in PTX ISA version 8.1.

Support for `.mmio` qualifier, `.release` semantics, `.global` state space, and
`.scope` qualifier introduced in PTX ISA version 8.7.

Target ISA Notes

Requires `sm_90` or higher.

`.mmio` qualifier, `.release` semantics, `.global` state space, and
`.scope` qualifier require `sm_100` or higher.

Examples

```
st.async.shared::cluster.mbarrier::complete_tx::bytes.u32 [addr], b, [mbar_addr];

st.async.sys.release.global.u32 [addr], b;
```
