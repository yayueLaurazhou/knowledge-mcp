Description

The `createpolicy` instruction creates a cache eviction policy for the specified cache level in an
opaque 64-bit register specified by the destination operand `cache-policy`. The cache eviction
policy specifies how cache eviction priorities are applied to global memory addresses used in memory
operations with `.level::cache_hint` qualifier.

There are two types of cache eviction policies:

* Range-based policy

  The cache eviction policy created using `createpolicy.range` specifies the cache eviction
  behaviors for the following three address ranges:

  + `[a .. a + (primary-size - 1)]` referred to as primary range.
  + `[a + primary-size .. a + (total-size - 1)]` referred to as trailing secondary range.
  + `[a - (total-size - primary-size) .. (a - 1)]` referred to as preceding secondary range.

  When a range-based cache eviction policy is used in a memory operation with
  `.level::cache_hint` qualifier, the eviction priorities are applied as follows:

  + If the memory address falls in the primary range, the eviction priority specified by
    `.L2::primary_priority` is applied.
  + If the memory address falls in any of the secondary ranges, the eviction priority specified by
    `.L2::secondary_priority` is applied.
  + If the memory address does not fall in either of the above ranges, then the applied eviction
    priority is unspecified.

  The 32-bit operand `primary-size` specifies the size, in bytes, of the primary range. The
  32-bit operand `total-size` specifies the combined size, in bytes, of the address range
  including primary and secondary ranges. The value of `primary-size` must be less than or equal
  to the value of `total-size`. Maximum allowed value of `total-size` is 4GB.

  If `.L2::secondary_priority` is not specified, then it defaults to `.L2::evict_unchanged`.

  If no state space is specified then [Generic Addressing](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#generic-addressing) is
  used. If the specified address does not fall within the address window of `.global` state space
  then the behavior is undefined.
* Fraction-based policy

  A memory operation with `.level::cache_hint` qualifier can use the fraction-based cache
  eviction policy to request the cache eviction priority specified by `.L2:primary_priority` to
  be applied to a fraction of cache accesses specified by the 32-bit floating point operand
  `fraction`. The remainder of the cache accesses get the eviction priority specified by
  `.L2::secondary_priority`. This implies that in a memory operation that uses a fraction-based
  cache policy, the memory access has a probability specified by the operand `fraction` of
  getting the cache eviction priority specified by `.L2::primary_priority`.

  The valid range of values for the operand `fraction` is `(0.0,.., 1.0]`. If the operand
  `fraction` is not specified, it defaults to 1.0.

  If `.L2::secondary_priority` is not specified, then it defaults to `.L2::evict_unchanged`.

The access property created using the CUDA APIs can be converted into cache eviction policy by the
instruction `createpolicy.cvt`. The source operand `access-property` is a 64-bit opaque
register. Refer to *CUDA programming guide* for more details.

Examples

```
createpolicy.fractional.L2::evict_last.b64                      policy, 1.0;
createpolicy.fractional.L2::evict_last.L2::evict_unchanged.b64  policy, 0.5;

createpolicy.range.L2::evict_last.L2::evict_first.b64
                                            policy, [ptr], 0x100000, 0x200000;

// access-prop is created by CUDA APIs.
createpolicy.cvt.L2.b64 policy, access-prop;
