#### 9.7.9.13. [Data Movement and Conversion Instructions: `st.bulk`](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#data-movement-and-conversion-instructions-st-bulk)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#data-movement-and-conversion-instructions-st-bulk "Permalink to this headline")

`st.bulk`

Initializes a region of memory as specified by state space.

Syntax

```
st.bulk{.weak}{.shared::cta}  [a], size, initval; // initval must be zero
```

Description

`st.bulk` instruction initializes a region of shared memory starting from the location specified
by destination address operand `a`.

The 32-bit or 64-bit integer operand `size` specifies the amount of memory to be initialized in terms of
number of bytes. `size` must be a multiple of 8. If the value is not a multiple of 8, then the
behavior is undefined. The maximum value of `size` operand can be 16777216.

The integer immediate operand `initval` specifies the initialization value for the memory
locations. The only numeric value allowed for operand `initval` is 0.

If no state space is specified then [Generic Addressing](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#generic-addressing) is used. If the
address specified by `a` does not fall within the address window of `.shared` state space then
the behavior is undefined.

The optional qualifier `.weak` specify the memory synchronizing effect of the `st.bulk`
instruction as described in the [Memory Consistency Model](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#memory-consistency-model).

PTX ISA Notes

Introduced in PTX ISA version 8.6.

Support for `size` operand with 32-bit length is introduced in PTX ISA version 9.0.

Target ISA Notes

Requires `sm_100` or higher.

Examples

```
st.bulk.weak.shared::cta  [dst], n, 0;

st.bulk                   [gdst], 4096, 0;
