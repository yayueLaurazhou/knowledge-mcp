Description

`cp.reduce.async.bulk.tensor` is a non-blocking instruction which initiates an asynchronous
reduction operation of tensor data in the `.dst` state space with tensor data in the `.src`
state space.

The operand `srcMem` specifies the location of the tensor data in the `.src` state space using
which the reduction operation has to be performed.

The operand `tensorMap` is the generic address of the opaque tensor-map object which resides
in `.param` space or `.const` space or `.global` space. The operand `tensorMap` specifies
the properties of the tensor copy operation, as described in [Tensor-map](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#tensor-tensormap).
The `tensorMap` is accessed in tensormap proxy. Refer to the *CUDA programming guide* for creating
the tensor-map objects on the host side.

Each element of the tensor data in the `.dst` state space is reduced inline with the corresponding
element from the tensor data in the `.src` state space. The modifier `.redOp` specifies the
reduction operation used for the inline reduction. The type of each tensor data element in the
source and the destination tensor is specified in [Tensor-map](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#tensor-tensormap).

The dimension of the tensor is specified by the `.dim` modifier.

The vector operand `tensorCoords` specifies the starting coordinates of the tensor data in the
global memory on which the reduce operation is to be performed. The number of tensor coordinates in
the vector argument `tensorCoords` should be equal to the dimension specified by the modifier
`.dim`. The individual tensor coordinates are of the type `.s32`.

The following table describes the valid combinations of `.redOp` and element type:

| `.redOp` | Element type |
| --- | --- |
| `.add` | `.u32`, `.s32`, `.u64`, `.f32`, `.f16`, `.bf16` |
| `.min`, `.max` | `.u32`, `.s32`, `.u64`, `.s64`, `.f16`, `.bf16` |
| `.inc`, `.dec` | `.u32` |
| `.and`, `.or`, `.xor` | `.b32`, `.b64` |

The modifier `.completion_mechanism` specifies the completion mechanism that is supported on the
instruction variant. Value `.bulk_group` of the modifier `.completion_mechanism` specifies that
`cp.reduce.async.bulk.tensor` instruction uses *bulk async-group* based completion mechanism.

The qualifier `.load_mode` specifies how the data in the source location is copied into the
destination location. If `.load_mode` is not specified, it defaults to `.tile`. In `.tile`
mode, the multi-dimensional layout of the source tensor is preserved at the destination. In
`.im2col_no_offs` mode, some dimensions of the source tensors are unrolled in a single dimensional
column at the destination. Details of the `im2col` mode are described in
[im2col mode](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#tensor-im2col-mode). In `.im2col` mode, the tensor has to be at least
3-dimensional.

When the optional argument `cache-policy` is specified, the qualifier `.level::cache_hint` is
required. The 64-bit operand `cache-policy` specifies the cache eviction policy that may be used
during the memory access.

`cache-policy` is a hint to the cache subsystem and may not always be respected. It is treated as
a performance hint only, and does not change the memory consistency behavior of the program. The
qualifier `.level::cache_hint` is only supported when at least one of the `.src` or `.dst`
statespaces is `.global` state space.

Each reduction operation performed by `cp.reduce.async.bulk.tensor` has individually
`.relaxed.gpu` memory ordering semantics. The load operations in `cp.reduce.async.bulk.tensor`
are treated as weak memory operations and the [complete-tx](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#parallel-synchronization-and-communication-instructions-mbarrier-complete-tx-operation)
operation on the mbarrier has `.release` semantics at the `.cluster` scope as described in the
[Memory Consistency Model](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#memory-consistency-model).
