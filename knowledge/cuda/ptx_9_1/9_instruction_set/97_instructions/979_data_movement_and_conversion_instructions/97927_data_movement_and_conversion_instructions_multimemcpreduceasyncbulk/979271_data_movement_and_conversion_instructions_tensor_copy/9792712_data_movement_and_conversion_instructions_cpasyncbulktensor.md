Description

`cp.async.bulk.tensor` is a non-blocking instruction which initiates an asynchronous copy
operation of tensor data from the location in `.src` state space to the location in the `.dst`
state space.

The operand `dstMem` specifies the location in the `.dst` state space into which the tensor data
has to be copied and `srcMem` specifies the location in the `.src` state space from which the
tensor data has to be copied.

When `.dst` is specified as `.shared::cta`, the address `dstMem` must be in the shared memory
of the executing CTA within the cluster, otherwise the behavior is undefined.

When `.dst` is specified as `.shared::cluster`, the address `dstMem` can be in the shared memory
of any of the CTAs within the current cluster.

The operand `tensorMap` is the generic address of the opaque tensor-map object which resides
in `.param` space or `.const` space or `.global` space. The operand `tensorMap` specifies
the properties of the tensor copy operation, as described in [Tensor-map](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#tensor-tensormap).
The `tensorMap` is accessed in tensormap proxy. Refer to the *CUDA programming guide* for creating
the tensor-map objects on the host side.

The dimension of the tensor data is specified by the `.dim` modifier.

The vector operand `tensorCoords` specifies the starting coordinates in the tensor data in the
global memory from or to which the copy operation has to be performed. The individual tensor
coordinates in `tensorCoords` are of type `.s32`. The format of vector argument `tensorCoords`
is dependent on `.load_mode` specified and is as follows:

| .load\_mode | tensorCoords | Semantics |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `.tile::scatter4` | {col\_idx, row\_idx0, row\_idx1, row\_idx2, row\_idx3} | Fixed length vector of size 5. The five elements together specify the start co-ordinates of the four rows. |
| `.tile::gather4` |
| Rest all | {d0, .., dn} for n = .dim | Vector of n elements where n = .dim. The elements indicate the offset in each of the dimension. |

The modifier `.completion_mechanism` specifies the completion mechanism that is supported on the
instruction variant. The completion mechanisms that are supported for different variants are
summarized in the following table:

| .completion-mechanism | `.dst` | `.src` | Completion mechanism | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Needed for completion of entire Async operation | optionally can be used for the completion of reading of the tensormap object |
| `.mbarrier::...` | `.shared::cta` | `.global` | mbarrier based | *Bulk async-group* based |
| `.shared::cluster` | `.global` |
| `.bulk_group` | `.global` | `.shared::cta` | *Bulk async-group* based |

The modifier `.mbarrier::complete_tx::bytes` specifies that the `cp.async.bulk.tensor` variant
uses mbarrier based completion mechanism. Upon the completion of the asynchronous copy operation, the
[complete-tx](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#parallel-synchronization-and-communication-instructions-mbarrier-complete-tx-operation)
operation, with `completeCount` argument equal to amount of data copied in bytes, will be
performed on the mbarrier object specified by the operand `mbar`.
This instruction accesses its `mbarrier` operand using generic-proxy.

The modifier `.cta_group` can only be specified with the mbarrier based completion mechanism. The
modifier `.cta_group` is used to signal either the odd numbered CTA or the even numbered CTA among
the [CTA-Pair](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#tcgen05-cta-pair). When `.cta_group::1` is specified, the mbarrier object `mbar`
that is specified must be in the shared memory of the same CTA as the shared memory destination `dstMem`.
When `.cta_group::2` is specified, the mbarrier object `mbar` can be in shared memory of either the
same CTA as the shared memory destination `dstMem` or in its [peer-CTA](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#tcgen05-peer-cta). If
`.cta_group` is not specified, then it defaults to `.cta_group::1`.

The modifier `.bulk_group` specifies that the `cp.async.bulk.tensor` variant uses *bulk
async-group* based completion mechanism.

The qualifier `.load_mode` specifies how the data in the source location is copied into the
destination location. If `.load_mode` is not specified, it defaults to `.tile`.

In `.tile` mode, the multi-dimensional layout of the source tensor is preserved at the destination.
In `.tile::gather4` mode, four rows in 2-dimnesional source tensor are combined to form a single 2-dimensional
destination tensor. In `.tile::scatter4` mode, single 2-dimensional source tensor is divided into four rows
in 2-dimensional destination tensor. Details of `.tile::scatter4`/`.tile::gather4` modes are described
in [.tile::scatter4 and .tile::gather4 modes](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#tensor-tiled-scatter4-gather4-modes).

In `.im2col` and `.im2col::*` modes, some dimensions of the source tensors are unrolled in a single
dimensional column at the destination. Details of the `im2col` and `.im2col::*` modes are described
in [im2col mode](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#tensor-im2col-mode) and [im2col::w and im2col::w::128 modes](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#tensor-im2col-w-w128-modes)
respectively. In `.im2col` and `.im2col::*` modes, the tensor has to be at least 3-dimensional. The vector
operand `im2colInfo` can be specified only when `.load_mode` is `.im2col` or `.im2col::w` or
`.im2col::w::128`. The format of the vector argument `im2colInfo` is dependent on the exact im2col mode
and is as follows:

| Exact im2col mode | im2colInfo argument | Semantics |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `.im2col` | { i2cOffW , i2cOffH , i2cOffD } for `.dim` = `.5d` | A vector of im2col offsets whose vector size is two less than number of dimensions .dim. |
| `.im2col::w` | { wHalo, wOffset } | A vector of 2 arguments containing [wHalo](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#tensor-im2col-w-w128-modes-whalo) and [wOffset](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#tensor-im2col-w-w128-modes-woffset) arguments. |
| `.im2col::w::128` |
| `.im2col_no_offs` | `im2colInfo` is not applicable. | `im2colInfo` is not applicable. |

Argument `wHalo` is a 16bit unsigned integer whose valid set of values differs on the load-mode and is as follows:
- Im2col::w mode : valid range is [0, 512).
- Im2col::w::128 mode : valid range is [0, 32).

Argument `wOffset` is a 16bit unsigned integer whose valid range of values is [0, 32).

The optional modifier `.multicast::cluster` allows copying of data from global memory to shared
memory of multiple CTAs in the cluster. Operand `ctaMask` specifies the destination CTAs in the
cluster such that each bit position in the 16-bit `ctaMask` operand corresponds to the `%ctaid`
of the destination CTA. The source data is multicast to the same offset as `dstMem` in the shared
memory of each destination CTA. When `.cta_group` is specified as:

* `.cta_group::1` : The mbarrier signal is also multicasted to the same offset as `mbar` in
  the shared memory of the destination CTA.
* `.cta_group::2` : The mbarrier signal is multicasted either to all the odd numbered CTAs or the
  even numbered CTAs within the corresponding [CTA-Pair](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#tcgen05-cta-pair). For each destination
  CTA specified in the `ctaMask`, the mbarrier signal is sent either to the destination CTA or its
  [peer-CTA](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#tcgen05-peer-cta) based on CTAs `%cluster_ctarank` parity of shared memory where
  the mbarrier object `mbar` resides.

When the optional argument `cache-policy` is specified, the qualifier `.level::cache_hint` is
required. The 64-bit operand `cache-policy` specifies the cache eviction policy that may be used
during the memory access.

`cache-policy` is a hint to the cache subsystem and may not always be respected. It is treated as
a performance hint only, and does not change the memory consistency behavior of the program.

The copy operation in `cp.async.bulk.tensor` is treated as a weak memory operation and the
[complete-tx](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#parallel-synchronization-and-communication-instructions-mbarrier-complete-tx-operation)
operation on the mbarrier has `.release` semantics at the `.cluster` scope as described in the
[Memory Consistency Model](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#memory-consistency-model).

Notes

`sm_103f`/`sm_103a`/`sm_110f`/`sm_110a` and may have substantially reduced performance on other
targets and hence `.multicast::cluster` is advised to be used with `.target` `sm_90a`/`sm_100f`/
