###### 9.7.9.27.2.2. [Data Movement and Conversion Instructions: `cp.async.bulk.wait_group`](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#data-movement-and-conversion-instructions-cp-async-bulk-wait-group)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#data-movement-and-conversion-instructions-cp-async-bulk-wait-group "Permalink to this headline")

`cp.async.bulk.wait_group`

Wait for completion of *bulk async-groups*.

Syntax

```
cp.async.bulk.wait_group{.read} N;

Description

`cp.async.bulk.wait_group` instruction will cause the executing thread to wait until only N or
fewer of the most recent *bulk async-groups* are pending and all the prior *bulk async-groups*
committed by the executing threads are complete. For example, when N is 0, the executing thread
waits on all the prior *bulk async-groups* to complete. Operand N is an integer constant.

By default, `cp.async.bulk.wait_group` instruction will cause the executing thread to wait until
completion of all the bulk async operations in the specified *bulk async-group*. A bulk async
operation includes the following:

* Optionally, reading from the tensormap.
* Reading from the source locations.
* Writing to their respective destination locations.
* Writes being made visible to the executing thread.

The optional `.read` modifier indicates that the waiting has to be done until all the bulk
async operations in the specified *bulk async-group* have completed:

1. reading from the tensormap
2. the reading from their source locations.
