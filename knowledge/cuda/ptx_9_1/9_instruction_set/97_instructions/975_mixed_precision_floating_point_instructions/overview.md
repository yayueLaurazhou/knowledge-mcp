# 9.7.5. Mixed Precision Floating-Point Instructions

### 9.7.5. [Mixed Precision Floating-Point Instructions](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#mixed-precision-floating-point-instructions)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#mixed-precision-floating-point-instructions "Permalink to this headline")

Mixed precision floating-point instructions operate on data with varied floating point precision.
Before executing the specified operation, operands with different precision needs to be converted
such that all the instruction operands can be represented with a consistent floating-point precision.
The register variable to be used for holding a particular operand depends upon the combination of
the instruction types. Refer [Fundamental Types](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#fundamental-types) and
[Alternate Floating-Point Data Formats](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#alternate-floating-point-data-formats) for more details
around exact register operand to be used for a given data type.

The mixed precision floating point instructions are:

* `add`
* `sub`
* `fma`

Mixed precision `add`, `sub`, `fma` support saturation of results to the range [0.0, 1.0],
with `NaN` being flushed to positive zero.
