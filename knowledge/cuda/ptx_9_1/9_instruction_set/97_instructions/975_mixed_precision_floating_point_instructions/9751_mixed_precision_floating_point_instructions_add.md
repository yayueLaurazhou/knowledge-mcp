# 9.7.5.1. Mixed Precision Floating Point Instructions: add

#### 9.7.5.1. [Mixed Precision Floating Point Instructions: `add`](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#mixed-precision-floating-point-instructions-add)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#mixed-precision-floating-point-instructions-add "Permalink to this headline")

`add`

Add 2 values.

Syntax

```
add{.rnd}{.sat}.f32.atype  d, a, c;

.atype = { .f16, .bf16};
.rnd   = { .rn, .rz, .rm, .rp };
```

Description

Converts input operand `a` from `.atype` into `.f32` type. The converted value is then
used for the addition. The resulting value is stored in the destination operand `d`.

Semantics

```
d = convert(a) + c;
```

Notes

Rounding modifiers:

`.rn`
:   mantissa LSB rounds to nearest even

`.rz`
:   mantissa LSB rounds towards zero

`.rm`
:   mantissa LSB rounds towards negative infinity

`.rp`
:   mantissa LSB rounds towards positive infinity

The default value of rounding modifier is `.rn`. Note that an `add` instruction with an explicit
rounding modifier is treated conservatively by the code optimizer. An `add` instruction with no
rounding modifier defaults to round-to-nearest-even and may be optimized aggressively by the code
optimizer. In particular, `mul`/`add` sequences with no rounding modifiers may be optimized to
use fused-multiply-add instructions on the target device.

Subnormal numbers:
:   By default, subnormal numbers are supported.

Saturation modifier:
:   `add.sat` clamps the result to [0.0, 1.0]. `NaN` results are flushed to `+0.0f`.

PTX ISA Notes

`add.f32.{f16/bf16}` introduced in PTX ISA version 8.6.

Target ISA Notes

`add.f32.{f16/bf16}` requires `sm_100` or higher.

Examples

```
.reg .f32 fc, fd;
.reg .b16 ba;
add.rz.f32.bf16.sat   fd, fa, fc;
```
