Description

Calculate `(a*b) + c`, with optional operand negates, *plus one* mode, and scaling.

The source operands support optional negation with some restrictions. Although PTX syntax allows
separate negation of the `a` and `b` operands, internally this is represented as negation of the
product `(a*b)`. That is, `(a*b)` is negated if and only if exactly one of `a` or `b` is
negated. PTX allows negation of either `(a*b)` or `c`.

The plus one mode (`.po`) computes `(a*b) + c + 1`, which is used in computing averages. Source
operands may not be negated in `.po` mode.

The intermediate result of `(a*b)` is unsigned if atype and btype are unsigned and the product
`(a*b)` is not negated; otherwise, the intermediate result is signed. Input `c` has the same
sign as the intermediate result.

The final result is unsigned if the intermediate result is unsigned and `c` is not negated.

Depending on the sign of the `a` and `b` operands, and the operand negates, the following
combinations of operands are supported for VMAD:

```
 (u32 * u32) + u32  // intermediate unsigned; final unsigned
-(u32 * u32) + s32  // intermediate   signed; final   signed
 (u32 * u32) - u32  // intermediate unsigned; final   signed
 (u32 * s32) + s32  // intermediate   signed; final   signed
-(u32 * s32) + s32  // intermediate   signed; final   signed
 (u32 * s32) - s32  // intermediate   signed; final   signed
 (s32 * u32) + s32  // intermediate   signed; final   signed
-(s32 * u32) + s32  // intermediate   signed; final   signed
 (s32 * u32) - s32  // intermediate   signed; final   signed
 (s32 * s32) + s32  // intermediate   signed; final   signed
-(s32 * s32) + s32  // intermediate   signed; final   signed
 (s32 * s32) - s32  // intermediate   signed; final   signed
```

The intermediate result is optionally scaled via right-shift; this result is sign-extended if the
final result is signed, and zero-extended otherwise.

The final result is optionally saturated to the appropriate 32-bit range based on the type (signed
or unsigned) of the final result.

Semantics

```
// extract byte/half-word/word and sign- or zero-extend
// based on source operand type
ta = partSelectSignExtend( a, atype, asel );
tb = partSelectSignExtend( b, btype, bsel );
signedFinal = isSigned(atype) || isSigned(btype) ||
                                 (a.negate ^ b.negate) || c.negate;
tmp[127:0] = ta * tb;

lsb = 0;
if ( .po )                  {              lsb = 1; } else
if ( a.negate ^ b.negate )  { tmp = ~tmp;  lsb = 1; } else
if ( c.negate )             { c   = ~c;    lsb = 1; }

c128[127:0] = (signedFinal) sext32( c ) : zext ( c );
tmp = tmp + c128 + lsb;
switch( scale ) {
   case .shr7:   result = (tmp >>  7) & 0xffffffffffffffff;
   case .shr15:  result = (tmp >> 15) & 0xffffffffffffffff;
}
if ( .sat ) {
     if (signedFinal) result = CLAMP(result, S32_MAX, S32_MIN);
     else             result = CLAMP(result, U32_MAX, U32_MIN);
}
