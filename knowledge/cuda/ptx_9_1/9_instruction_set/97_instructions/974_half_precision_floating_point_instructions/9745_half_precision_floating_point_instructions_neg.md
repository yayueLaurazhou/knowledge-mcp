# 9.7.4.5. Half Precision Floating Point Instructions: neg

#### 9.7.4.5. [Half Precision Floating Point Instructions: `neg`](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#half-precision-floating-point-instructions-neg)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#half-precision-floating-point-instructions-neg "Permalink to this headline")

`neg`

Arithmetic negate.

Syntax

```
neg{.ftz}.f16    d, a;
neg{.ftz}.f16x2  d, a;
neg.bf16         d, a;
neg.bf16x2       d, a;
```

Description

Negate the sign of `a` and store the result in `d`.

For `.f16x2` and `.bf16x2` instruction type, forms input vector by extracting half word values
from the source operand. Half-word operands are then negated in parallel to produce `.f16x2` or
`.bf16x2` result in destination.

For `.f16` instruction type, operands `d` and `a` have `.f16` or `.b16` type. For
`.f16x2` instruction type, operands `d` and `a` have `.b32` type. For `.bf16` instruction
type, operands `d` and `a` have `.b16` type. For `.bf16x2` instruction type, operands `d`
and `a` have `.b32` type.

Semantics

```
if (type == f16 || type == bf16) {
    d = -a;
} else if (type == f16x2 || type == bf16x2) {
    fA[0] = a[0:15];
    fA[1] = a[16:31];
    for (i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
         d[i] = -fA[i];
    }
}

Notes

Subnormal numbers:
:   By default, subnormal numbers are supported.
    `neg.ftz.{f16, f16x2}` flushes subnormal inputs and results to sign-preserving zero.

`NaN` inputs yield an unspecified `NaN`. Future implementations may comply with the IEEE 754
standard by preserving payload and modifying only the sign bit.

PTX ISA Notes

Introduced in PTX ISA version 6.0.

`neg.bf16` and `neg.bf16x2` introduced in PTX ISA 7.0.

Target ISA Notes

Requires `sm_53` or higher.

`neg.bf16` and `neg.bf16x2` requires architecture `sm_80` or higher.

Examples

```
neg.ftz.f16  x,f0;
neg.bf16     x,b0;
neg.bf16x2   x1,b1;
```
