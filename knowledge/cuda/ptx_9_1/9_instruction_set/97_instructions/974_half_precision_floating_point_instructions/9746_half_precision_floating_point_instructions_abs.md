# 9.7.4.6. Half Precision Floating Point Instructions: abs

#### 9.7.4.6. [Half Precision Floating Point Instructions: `abs`](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#half-precision-floating-point-instructions-abs)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#half-precision-floating-point-instructions-abs "Permalink to this headline")

`abs`

Absolute value

Syntax

```
abs{.ftz}.f16    d, a;
abs{.ftz}.f16x2  d, a;
abs.bf16         d, a;
abs.bf16x2       d, a;
```

Description

Take absolute value of `a` and store the result in `d`.

For `.f16x2` and `.bf16x2` instruction type, forms input vector by extracting half word values
from the source operand. Absolute values of half-word operands are then computed in parallel to
produce `.f16x2` or `.bf16x2` result in destination.

For `.f16` instruction type, operands `d` and `a` have `.f16` or `.b16` type. For
`.f16x2` instruction type, operands `d` and `a` have `.f16x2` or `.b32` type. For
`.bf16` instruction type, operands `d` and `a` have `.b16` type. For `.bf16x2` instruction
type, operands `d` and `a` have `.b32` type.

Semantics

```
if (type == f16 || type == bf16) {
    d = |a|;
} else if (type == f16x2 || type == bf16x2) {
    fA[0] = a[0:15];
    fA[1] = a[16:31];
    for (i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
         d[i] = |fA[i]|;
    }
}

Notes

Subnormal numbers:
:   By default, subnormal numbers are supported.
    `abs.ftz.{f16, f16x2}` flushes subnormal inputs and results to sign-preserving zero.

`NaN` inputs yield an unspecified `NaN`. Future implementations may comply with the IEEE 754
standard by preserving payload and modifying only the sign bit.

PTX ISA Notes

Introduced in PTX ISA version 6.5.

`abs.bf16` and `abs.bf16x2` introduced in PTX ISA 7.0.

Target ISA Notes

Requires `sm_53` or higher.

`abs.bf16` and `abs.bf16x2` requires architecture `sm_80` or higher.

Examples

```
abs.ftz.f16  x,f0;
abs.bf16     x,b0;
abs.bf16x2   x1,b1;
