# 9.7.4.9. Half Precision Floating Point Instructions: tanh

#### 9.7.4.9. [Half Precision Floating Point Instructions: `tanh`](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#half-precision-floating-point-instructions-tanh)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#half-precision-floating-point-instructions-tanh "Permalink to this headline")

`tanh`

Find the hyperbolic tangent of a value (in radians)

Syntax

```
tanh.approx.type d, a;

.type = {.f16, .f16x2, .bf16, .bf16x2}
```

Description

Take hyperbolic tangent value of `a`.

The type of operands `d` and `a` are as specified by `.type`.

For `.f16x2` or `.bf16x2` instruction type, each of the half-word operands are operated in
parallel and the results are packed appropriately into a `.f16x2` or `.bf16x2`.

Semantics

```
if (.type == .f16 || .type == .bf16) {
  d = tanh(a)
} else if (.type == .f16x2 || .type == .bf16x2) {
  fA[0] = a[0:15];
  fA[1] = a[16:31];
  d[0] = tanh(fA[0])
  d[1] = tanh(fA[1])
}
```

Notes

`tanh.approx.{f16, f16x2, bf16, bf16x2}` implements an approximate hyperbolic tangent in the
target format.

Results of `tanh` for various corner-case inputs are as follows:

| Input | Result |
| --- | --- |
| -Inf | -1.0 |
| -0.0 | -0.0 |
| +0.0 | +0.0 |
| +Inf | 1.0 |
| NaN | NaN |

The maximum absolute error for `.f16` type is 2-10.987. The maximum absolute error for `.bf16`
type is 2-8.

The subnormal numbers are supported.

PTX ISA Notes

Introduced in PTX ISA version 7.0.

`tanh.approx.{bf16/bf16x2}` introduced in PTX ISA version 7.8.

Target ISA Notes

Requires `sm_75` or higher.

`tanh.approx.{bf16/bf16x2}` requires `sm_90` or higher.

Examples

```
tanh.approx.f16    h1, h0;
tanh.approx.f16x2  hd1, hd0;
tanh.approx.bf16   b1, b0;
