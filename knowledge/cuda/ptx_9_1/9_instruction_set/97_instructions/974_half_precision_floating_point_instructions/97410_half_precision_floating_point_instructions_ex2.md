#### 9.7.4.10. [Half Precision Floating Point Instructions: `ex2`](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#half-precision-floating-point-instructions-ex2)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#half-precision-floating-point-instructions-ex2 "Permalink to this headline")

`ex2`

Find the base-2 exponent of input.

Syntax

```
ex2.approx.atype     d, a;
ex2.approx.ftz.btype d, a;

.atype = { .f16,  .f16x2}
.btype = { .bf16, .bf16x2}
```

Description

Raise 2 to the power `a`.

The type of operands `d` and `a` are as specified by `.type`.

For `.f16x2` or `.bf16x2` instruction type, each of the half-word operands are operated in
parallel and the results are packed appropriately into a `.f16x2` or `.bf16x2`.

Semantics

```
if (.type == .f16 || .type == .bf16) {
  d = 2 ^ a
} else if (.type == .f16x2 || .type == .bf16x2) {
  fA[0] = a[0:15];
  fA[1] = a[16:31];
  d[0] = 2 ^ fA[0]
  d[1] = 2 ^ fA[1]
}

Notes

`ex2.approx.{f16, f16x2, bf16, bf16x2}` implement a fast approximation to 2a.

For the `.f16` type, subnormal inputs are supported. `ex2.approx.ftz.bf16` flushes subnormal
inputs and results to sign-preserving zero.

Results of `ex2.approx.ftz.bf16` for various corner-case inputs are as follows:

| Input | Result |
| --- | --- |
| -Inf | +0.0 |
| -subnormal | +1.0 |
| -0.0 | +1.0 |
| +0.0 | +1.0 |
| +subnormal | +1.0 |
| +Inf | +Inf |
| NaN | NaN |

Results of `ex2.approx.f16` for various corner-case inputs are as follows:

| Input | Result |
| --- | --- |
| -Inf | +0.0 |
| -0.0 | +1.0 |
| +0.0 | +1.0 |
| +Inf | +Inf |
| NaN | NaN |

The maximum relative error for `.f16` type is 2-9.9. The maximum relative error for `.bf16` type
is 2-7.

PTX ISA Notes

Introduced in PTX ISA version 7.0.

`ex2.approx.ftz.{bf16/bf16x2}` introduced in PTX ISA version 7.8.

Target ISA Notes

Requires `sm_75` or higher.

`ex2.approx.ftz.{bf16/bf16x2}` requires `sm_90` or higher.
