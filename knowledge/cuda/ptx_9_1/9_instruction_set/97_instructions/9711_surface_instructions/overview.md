### 9.7.11. [Surface Instructions](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#surface-instructions)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#surface-instructions "Permalink to this headline")

This section describes PTX instructions for accessing surfaces. PTX supports the following
operations on surface descriptors:

* Static initialization of surface descriptors.
* Module-scope and per-entry scope definitions of surface descriptors.
* Ability to query fields within surface descriptors.

These instructions provide access to surface memory.

* `suld`
* `sust`
* `sured`
* `suq`
