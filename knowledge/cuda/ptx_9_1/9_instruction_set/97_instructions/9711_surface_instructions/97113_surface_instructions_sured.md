`sured`

Reduce surface memory.

Syntax

```
sured.b.op.geom.ctype.clamp  [a,b],c; // byte addressing
sured.p.op.geom.ctype.clamp  [a,b],c; // sample addressing

.op    = { .add, .min, .max, .and, .or };
.geom  = { .1d, .2d, .3d };
.ctype = { .u32, .u64, .s32, .b32, .s64 };  // for sured.b
.ctype = { .b32, .b64 };                    // for sured.p
.clamp = { .trap, .clamp, .zero };

Description

Reduction to surface memory using a surface coordinate vector. The instruction performs a reduction
operation with data from operand `c` to the surface named by operand `a` at coordinates given by
operand `b`. Operand `a` is a `.surfref` variable or `.u64` register. Operand `b` is a
scalar or singleton tuple for 1d surfaces; is a two-element vector for 2d surfaces; and is a
four-element vector for 3d surfaces, where the fourth element is ignored. Coordinate elements are of
type `.s32`.

`sured.b` performs an unformatted reduction on `.u32`, `.s32`, `.b32`, `.u64`, or `.s64`
data. The lowest dimension coordinate represents a byte offset into the surface and is not
scaled. Operation `add` applies to `.u32`, `.u64`, and `.s32` types; `min` and `max`
apply to `.u32`, `.s32`, `.u64` and `.s64` types; operations `and` and `or` apply to
`.b32` type.

`sured.p` performs an unformatted reduction on sample-addressed data. The lowest dimension coordinate
represents a sample offset rather than a byte offset and is scaled by the data-size given by `.ctype`.
The instruction type `.b64` is restricted to `min` and `max` operations. For type `.b32`,
the data is interpreted as `.u32` or `.s32` based on the surface sample format as follows:
if the surface format contains `UINT` data, then `.u32` is assumed; if the surface format contains
`SINT` data, then `.s32` is assumed. For type `.b64`, if the surface format contains `UINT` data,
then `.u64` is assumed; if the surface format contains `SINT` data, then `.s64` is assumed.

A surface base address is assumed to be aligned to a 16 byte boundary, and the address given by the
coordinate vector must be naturally aligned to a multiple of the access size. If an address is not
properly aligned, the resulting behavior is undefined; i.e., the access may proceed by silently
masking off low-order address bits to achieve proper rounding, or the instruction may fault.

The `.clamp` field specifies how to handle out-of-bounds addresses:

`.trap`
:   causes an execution trap on out-of-bounds addresses

`.clamp`
:   stores data at the nearest surface location (sized appropriately)

`.zero`
:   drops stores to out-of-bounds addresses

Indirect surface access

Beginning with PTX ISA version 3.1, indirect surface access is supported for target architecture
`sm_20` or higher. In indirect access, operand `a` is a `.u64` register holding the address of
a `.surfref` variable.

PTX ISA Notes

Introduced in PTX ISA version 2.0.

Indirect surface access introduced in PTX ISA version 3.1.

`.u64`/`.s64`/`.b64` types with `.min`/`.max` operations introduced in PTX ISA version
8.1.

Target ISA Notes

sured requires `sm_20` or higher.

Indirect surface access requires `sm_20` or higher.

`.u64`/`.s64`/`.b64` types with `.min`/`.max` operations requires `sm_50` or higher.

Examples

```
sured.b.add.2d.u32.trap  [surf_A, {x,y}], r1;
sured.p.min.1d.u32.trap  [surf_B, {x}], r1;
sured.b.max.1d.u64.trap  [surf_C, {x}], r1;
sured.p.min.1d.b64.trap  [surf_D, {x}], r1;
