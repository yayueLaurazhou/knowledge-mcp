#### 9.7.1.19. [Integer Arithmetic Instructions: `bfe`](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#integer-arithmetic-instructions-bfe)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#integer-arithmetic-instructions-bfe "Permalink to this headline")

`bfe`

Bit Field Extract.

Syntax

```
bfe.type  d, a, b, c;

.type = { .u32, .u64,
          .s32, .s64 };
```

Description

Extract bit field from `a` and place the zero or sign-extended result in `d`. Source `b` gives
the bit field starting bit position, and source `c` gives the bit field length in bits.

Operands `a` and `d` have the same type as the instruction type. Operands `b` and `c` are
type `.u32`, but are restricted to the 8-bit value range `0..255`.

The sign bit of the extracted field is defined as:

`.u32`, `.u64`:
:   zero

`.s32`, `.s64`:
:   `msb` of input a if the extracted field extends beyond the `msb` of a `msb` of extracted
    field, otherwise

If the bit field length is zero, the result is zero.

The destination `d` is padded with the sign bit of the extracted field. If the start position is
beyond the `msb` of the input, the destination `d` is filled with the replicated sign bit of the
extracted field.

Semantics

```
msb = (.type==.u32 || .type==.s32) ? 31 : 63;
pos = b & 0xff;  // pos restricted to 0..255 range
len = c & 0xff;  // len restricted to 0..255 range

if (.type==.u32 || .type==.u64 || len==0)
    sbit = 0;
else
    sbit = a[min(pos+len-1,msb)];

d = 0;
for (i=0; i<=msb; i++) {
    d[i] = (i<len && pos+i<=msb) ? a[pos+i] : sbit;
}
