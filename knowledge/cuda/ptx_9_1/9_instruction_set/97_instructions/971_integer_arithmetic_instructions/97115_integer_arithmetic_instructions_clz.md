# 9.7.1.15. Integer Arithmetic Instructions: clz

#### 9.7.1.15. [Integer Arithmetic Instructions: `clz`](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#integer-arithmetic-instructions-clz)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#integer-arithmetic-instructions-clz "Permalink to this headline")

`clz`

Count leading zeros.

Syntax

```
clz.type  d, a;

.type = { .b32, .b64 };
```

Description

Count the number of leading zeros in `a` starting with the most-significant bit and place the
result in 32-bit destination register `d`. Operand `a` has the instruction type, and destination
`d` has type `.u32`. For `.b32` type, the number of leading zeros is between 0 and 32,
inclusively. For `.b64` type, the number of leading zeros is between 0 and 64, inclusively.

Semantics

```
.u32  d = 0;
if (.type == .b32)   { max = 32; mask = 0x80000000; }
else                 { max = 64; mask = 0x8000000000000000; }

while (d < max && (a&mask == 0) ) {
    d++;
    a = a << 1;
}

PTX ISA Notes

Introduced in PTX ISA version 2.0.

Target ISA Notes

`clz` requires `sm_20` or higher.

Examples

```
clz.b32  d, a;
clz.b64  cnt, X;  // cnt is .u32
```
