# 9.7.1.4. Integer Arithmetic Instructions: mad

#### 9.7.1.4. [Integer Arithmetic Instructions: `mad`](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#integer-arithmetic-instructions-mad)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#integer-arithmetic-instructions-mad "Permalink to this headline")

`mad`

Multiply two values, optionally extract the high or low half of the intermediate result, and add a third value.

Syntax

```
mad.mode.type  d, a, b, c;
mad.hi.sat.s32 d, a, b, c;

.mode = { .hi, .lo, .wide };
.type = { .u16, .u32, .u64,
          .s16, .s32, .s64 };
```

Description

Multiplies two values, optionally extracts the high or low half of the intermediate result, and adds
a third value. Writes the result into a destination register.

Semantics

```
t = a * b;
n = bitwidth of type;
d = t + c;           // for .wide
d = t<2n-1..n> + c;  // for .hi variant
d = t<n-1..0> + c;   // for .lo variant
```

Notes

The type of the operation represents the types of the `a` and `b` operands. If .hi or .lo is
specified, then `d` and `c` are the same size as `a` and `b`, and either the upper or lower
half of the result is written to the destination register. If `.wide` is specified, then `d` and
`c` are twice as wide as `a` and `b` to receive the result of the multiplication.

The `.wide` suffix is supported only for 16-bit and 32-bit integer types.

Saturation modifier:

`.sat`
:   limits result to `MININT..MAXINT` (no overflow) for the size of the operation.

    Applies only to `.s32` type in `.hi` mode.

PTX ISA Notes

Introduced in PTX ISA version 1.0.

Target ISA Notes

Supported on all target architectures.

Examples

```
@p  mad.lo.s32 d,a,b,c;
    mad.lo.s32 r,p,q,r;
```
