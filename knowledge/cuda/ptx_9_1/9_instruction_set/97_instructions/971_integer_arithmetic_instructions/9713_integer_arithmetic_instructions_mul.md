# 9.7.1.3. Integer Arithmetic Instructions: mul

#### 9.7.1.3. [Integer Arithmetic Instructions: `mul`](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#integer-arithmetic-instructions-mul)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#integer-arithmetic-instructions-mul "Permalink to this headline")

`mul`

Multiply two values.

Syntax

```
mul.mode.type  d, a, b;

.mode = { .hi, .lo, .wide };
.type = { .u16, .u32, .u64,
          .s16, .s32, .s64 };
```

Description

Compute the product of two values.

Semantics

```
t = a * b;
n = bitwidth of type;
d = t;            // for .wide
d = t<2n-1..n>;   // for .hi variant
d = t<n-1..0>;    // for .lo variant
```

Notes

The type of the operation represents the types of the `a` and `b` operands. If `.hi` or
`.lo` is specified, then `d` is the same size as `a` and `b`, and either the upper or lower
half of the result is written to the destination register. If `.wide` is specified, then `d` is
twice as wide as `a` and `b` to receive the full result of the multiplication.

The `.wide` suffix is supported only for 16- and 32-bit integer types.

PTX ISA Notes

Introduced in PTX ISA version 1.0.

Target ISA Notes

Supported on all target architectures.

Examples

```
mul.wide.s16 fa,fxs,fys;   // 16*16 bits yields 32 bits
mul.lo.s16 fa,fxs,fys;     // 16*16 bits, save only the low 16 bits
mul.wide.s32 z,x,y;        // 32*32 bits, creates 64 bit result
