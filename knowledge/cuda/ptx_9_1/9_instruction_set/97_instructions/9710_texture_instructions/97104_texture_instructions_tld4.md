Description

Texture fetch of the 4-texel bilerp footprint using a texture coordinate vector. The instruction
loads the bilerp footprint from the texture named by operand `a` at coordinates given by operand
`c` into vector destination `d`. The texture component fetched for each texel sample is
specified by `.comp`. The four texel samples are placed into destination vector `d` in
counter-clockwise order starting at lower left.

An optional texture sampler `b` may be specified. If no sampler is specified, the sampler behavior
is a property of the named texture.

The optional destination predicate `p` is set to `True` if data from texture at specified
coordinates is resident in memory, `False` otherwise. When optional destination predicate `p` is
set to `False`, data loaded will be all zeros. Memory residency of Texture Data at specified
coordinates is dependent on execution environment setup using Driver API calls, prior to kernel
launch. Refer to Driver API documentation for more details including any system/implementation
specific behavior.

An optional operand `f` may be specified for *depth textures*. Depth textures are special type of
textures which hold data from the depth buffer. Depth buffer contains depth information of each
pixel. Operand `f` is `.f32` scalar value that specifies depth compare value for depth
textures. Each element fetched from texture is compared against value given in `f` operand. If
comparison passes, result is 1.0; otherwise result is 0.0. These per-element comparison results are
used for the filtering.

A texture base address is assumed to be aligned to a 16 byte boundary, and the address given by the
coordinate vector must be naturally aligned to a multiple of the access size. If an address is not
properly aligned, the resulting behavior is undefined; i.e., the access may proceed by silently
masking off low-order address bits to achieve proper rounding, or the instruction may fault.

`tld4.2d`

For 2D textures, operand `c` specifies coordinates as a two-element, 32-bit floating-point vector.

An optional operand `e` may be specified. Operand `e` is a vector of type `.v2.s32` that
specifies coordinate offset. Offset is applied to coordinates before doing texture fetch. Offset
value is in the range of -8 to +7.

`tld4.a2d`

Texture array selection, followed by `tld4` texture fetch of 2d texture. For 2d texture arrays
operand `c` is a four element, 32-bit vector. The first element in operand c is interpreted as an
unsigned integer index (`.u32`) into the texture array, and the next two elements are interpreted
as 32-bit floating point coordinates of 2d texture. The fourth element is ignored.

An optional operand `e` may be specified. Operand `e` is a vector of type `.v2.s32` that
specifies coordinate offset. Offset is applied to coordinates before doing texture fetch. Offset
value is in the range of -8 to +7.

`tld4.cube`

For cubemap textures, operand `c` specifies four-element vector which comprises three
floating-point coordinates (s, t, r) and a fourth padding argument which is ignored.

Cubemap textures are special two-dimensional layered textures consisting of six layers that
represent the faces of a cube. All layers in a cubemap are of the same size and are square (i.e.,
width equals height).

Coordinates (s, t, r) are projected onto one of the six cube faces. The (s, t, r) coordinates can be
thought of as a direction vector emanating from the center of the cube. Of the three coordinates (s,
t, r), the coordinate of the largest magnitude (the major axis) selects the cube face. Then, the
other two coordinates (the minor axes) are divided by the absolute value of the major axis to
produce a new (s, t) coordinate pair to lookup into the selected cube face.

Offset vector operand `e` is not supported for cubemap textures.

`tld4.acube`

Cubemap array selection, followed by `tld4` texture fetch of cubemap texture. The first element in
operand `c` is interpreted as an unsigned integer index (`.u32`) into the cubemap texture array,
and the remaining three elements are interpreted as floating-point cubemap coordinates (s, t, r),
used to lookup in the selected cubemap.

Offset vector operand `e` is not supported for cubemap texture arrays.

Indirect texture access

Beginning with PTX ISA version 3.1, indirect texture access is supported in unified mode for target
architecture `sm_20` or higher. In indirect access, operand `a` is a `.u64` register holding
the address of a `.texref` variable.
