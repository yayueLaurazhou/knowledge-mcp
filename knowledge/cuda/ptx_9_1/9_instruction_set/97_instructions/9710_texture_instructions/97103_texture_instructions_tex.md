Description

`tex.{1d,2d,3d}`

Texture lookup using a texture coordinate vector. The instruction loads data from the texture named
by operand `a` at coordinates given by operand `c` into destination `d`. Operand `c` is a
scalar or singleton tuple for 1d textures; is a two-element vector for 2d textures; and is a
four-element vector for 3d textures, where the fourth element is ignored. An optional texture
sampler `b` may be specified. If no sampler is specified, the sampler behavior is a property of
the named texture. The optional destination predicate `p` is set to `True` if data from texture
at specified coordinates is resident in memory, `False` otherwise. When optional destination
predicate `p` is set to `False`, data loaded will be all zeros. Memory residency of Texture Data
at specified coordinates is dependent on execution environment setup using Driver API calls, prior
to kernel launch. Refer to Driver API documentation for more details including any
system/implementation specific behavior.

An optional operand `e` may be specified. Operand `e` is a vector of `.s32` values that
specifies coordinate offset. Offset is applied to coordinates before doing texture lookup. Offset
value is in the range of -8 to +7. Operand `e` is a singleton tuple for 1d textures; is a two
element vector 2d textures; and is four-element vector for 3d textures, where the fourth element is
ignored.

An optional operand `f` may be specified for `depth textures`. Depth textures are special type
of textures which hold data from the depth buffer. Depth buffer contains depth information of each
pixel. Operand `f` is `.f32` scalar value that specifies depth compare value for depth
textures. Each element fetched from texture is compared against value given in `f` operand. If
comparison passes, result is 1.0; otherwise result is 0.0. These per-element comparison results are
used for the filtering. When using depth compare operand, the elements in texture coordinate vector
`c` have `.f32` type.

Depth compare operand is not supported for `3d` textures.

The instruction returns a two-element vector for destination type `.f16x2`. For all other
destination types, the instruction returns a four-element vector. Coordinates may be given in either
signed 32-bit integer or 32-bit floating point form.

A texture base address is assumed to be aligned to a 16 byte boundary, and the address given by the
coordinate vector must be naturally aligned to a multiple of the access size. If an address is not
properly aligned, the resulting behavior is undefined; i.e., the access may proceed by silently
masking off low-order address bits to achieve proper rounding, or the instruction may fault.

`tex.{a1d,a2d}`

Texture array selection, followed by texture lookup. The instruction first selects a texture from
the texture array named by operand `a` using the index given by the first element of the array
coordinate vector `c`. The instruction then loads data from the selected texture at coordinates
given by the remaining elements of operand `c` into destination `d`. Operand `c` is a bit-size
type vector or tuple containing an index into the array of textures followed by coordinates within
the selected texture, as follows:

* For 1d texture arrays, operand `c` has type `.v2.b32`. The first element is interpreted as an
  unsigned integer index (`.u32`) into the texture array, and the second element is interpreted as
  a 1d texture coordinate of type `.ctype`.
* For 2d texture arrays, operand `c` has type `.v4.b32`. The first element is interpreted as an
  unsigned integer index (`.u32`) into the texture array, and the next two elements are
  interpreted as 2d texture coordinates of type `.ctype`. The fourth element is ignored.

An optional texture sampler `b` may be specified. If no sampler is specified, the sampler behavior
is a property of the named texture.

An optional operand `e` may be specified. Operand `e` is a vector of `.s32` values that
specifies coordinate offset. Offset is applied to coordinates before doing texture lookup. Offset
value is in the range of -8 to +7. Operand `e` is a singleton tuple for 1d texture arrays; and is
a two element vector 2d texture arrays.

An optional operand `f` may be specified for depth textures arrays. Operand `f` is `.f32`
scalar value that specifies depth compare value for depth textures. When using depth compare
operand, the coordinates in texture coordinate vector `c` have `.f32` type.

The instruction returns a two-element vector for destination type `.f16x2`. For all other
destination types, the instruction returns a four-element vector. The texture array index is a
32-bit unsigned integer, and texture coordinate elements are 32-bit signed integer or floating point
values.

The optional destination predicate `p` is set to `True` if data from texture at specified
coordinates is resident in memory, `False` otherwise. When optional destination predicate `p` is
set to `False`, data loaded will be all zeros. Memory residency of Texture Data at specified
coordinates is dependent on execution environment setup using Driver API calls, prior to kernel
launch. Refer to Driver API documentation for more details including any system/implementation
specific behavior.

`tex.cube`

*Cubemap* texture lookup. The instruction loads data from the cubemap texture named by operand `a`
at coordinates given by operand `c` into destination `d`. Cubemap textures are special
two-dimensional layered textures consisting of six layers that represent the faces of a cube. All
layers in a cubemap are of the same size and are square (i.e., width equals height).

When accessing a cubemap, the texture coordinate vector `c` has type `.v4.f32`, and comprises
three floating-point coordinates (`s`, `t`, `r`) and a fourth padding argument which is
ignored. Coordinates (`s`, `t`, `r`) are projected onto one of the six cube faces. The (`s`,
`t`, `r`) coordinates can be thought of as a direction vector emanating from the center of the
cube. Of the three coordinates (`s`, `t`, `r`), the coordinate of the largest magnitude (the
major axis) selects the cube face. Then, the other two coordinates (the minor axes) are divided by
the absolute value of the major axis to produce a new (`s`, `t`) coordinate pair to lookup into
the selected cube face.

An optional texture sampler `b` may be specified. If no sampler is specified, the sampler behavior
is a property of the named texture.

Offset vector operand `e` is not supported for cubemap textures.

an optional operand `f` may be specified for cubemap depth textures. operand `f` is `.f32`
scalar value that specifies depth compare value for cubemap depth textures.

The optional destination predicate `p` is set to `True` if data from texture at specified
coordinates is resident in memory, `False` otherwise. When optional destination predicate `p` is
set to `False`, data loaded will be all zeros. Memory residency of Texture Data at specified
coordinates is dependent on execution environment setup using Driver API calls, prior to kernel
launch. Refer to Driver API documentation for more details including any system/implementation
specific behavior.

`tex.acube`

Cubemap array selection, followed by cubemap lookup. The instruction first selects a cubemap texture
from the cubemap array named by operand `a` using the index given by the first element of the
array coordinate vector `c`. The instruction then loads data from the selected cubemap texture at
coordinates given by the remaining elements of operand `c` into destination `d`.

*Cubemap array* textures consist of an array of cubemaps, i.e., the total number of layers is a
multiple of six. When accessing a cubemap array texture, the coordinate vector `c` has type
`.v4.b32`. The first element is interpreted as an unsigned integer index (`.u32`) into the
cubemap array, and the remaining three elements are interpreted as floating-point cubemap
coordinates (`s`, `t`, `r`), used to lookup in the selected cubemap as described above.

An optional texture sampler `b` may be specified. If no sampler is specified, the sampler behavior
is a property of the named texture.

Offset vector operand `e` is not supported for cubemap texture arrays.

An optional operand `f` may be specified for cubemap depth texture arrays. Operand `f` is
`.f32` scalar value that specifies depth compare value for cubemap depth textures.

The optional destination predicate `p` is set to `True` if data from texture at specified
coordinates is resident in memory, `False` otherwise. When optional destination predicate `p` is
set to `False`, data loaded will be all zeros. Memory residency of Texture Data at specified
coordinates is dependent on execution environment setup using Driver API calls, prior to kernel
launch. Refer to Driver API documentation for more details including any system/implementation
specific behavior.

`tex.2dms`

Multi-sample texture lookup using a texture coordinate vector. Multi-sample textures consist of
multiple samples per data element. The instruction loads data from the texture named by operand
`a` from sample number given by first element of the operand `c`, at coordinates given by
remaining elements of operand `c` into destination `d`. When accessing a multi-sample texture,
texture coordinate vector `c` has type `.v4.b32`. The first element in operand `c` is
interpreted as unsigned integer sample number (`.u32`), and the next two elements are interpreted
as signed integer (`.s32`) 2d texture coordinates. The fourth element is ignored. An optional
texture sampler `b` may be specified. If no sampler is specified, the sampler behavior is a
property of the named texture.

An optional operand `e` may be specified. Operand `e` is a vector of type `.v2.s32` that
specifies coordinate offset. Offset is applied to coordinates before doing texture lookup. Offset
value is in the range of -8 to +7.

Depth compare operand `f` is not supported for multi-sample textures.

The optional destination predicate `p` is set to `True` if data from texture at specified
coordinates is resident in memory, `False` otherwise. When optional destination predicate `p` is
set to `False`, data loaded will be all zeros. Memory residency of Texture Data at specified
coordinates is dependent on execution environment setup using Driver API calls, prior to kernel
launch. Refer to Driver API documentation for more details including any system/implementation
specific behavior.

`tex.a2dms`

Multi-sample texture array selection, followed by multi-sample texture lookup. The instruction first
selects a multi-sample texture from the multi-sample texture array named by operand a using the
index given by the first element of the array coordinate vector `c`. The instruction then loads
data from the selected multi-sample texture from sample number given by second element of the
operand `c`, at coordinates given by remaining elements of operand `c` into destination
`d`. When accessing a multi-sample texture array, texture coordinate vector `c` has type
`.v4.b32`. The first element in operand c is interpreted as unsigned integer sampler number, the
second element is interpreted as unsigned integer index (`.u32`) into the multi-sample texture
array and the next two elements are interpreted as signed integer (`.s32`) 2d texture
coordinates. An optional texture sampler `b` may be specified. If no sampler is specified, the
sampler behavior is a property of the named texture.

An optional operand `e` may be specified. Operand `e` is a vector of type `.v2.s32` values
that specifies coordinate offset. Offset is applied to coordinates before doing texture
lookup. Offset value is in the range of -8 to +7.

Depth compare operand `f` is not supported for multi-sample texture arrays.

The optional destination predicate `p` is set to `True` if data from texture at specified
coordinates is resident in memory, `False` otherwise. When optional destination predicate `p` is
set to `False`, data loaded will be all zeros. Memory residency of Texture Data at specified
coordinates is dependent on execution environment setup using Driver API calls, prior to kernel
launch. Refer to Driver API documentation for more details including any system/implementation
specific behavior.

Mipmaps

`.base` (lod zero)
:   Pick level 0 (base level). This is the default if no mipmap mode is specified. No additional arguments.

`.level` (lod explicit)
:   Requires an additional 32-bit scalar argument, `lod`, which contains the LOD to fetch from. The
    type of `lod` follows `.ctype` (either `.s32` or `.f32`). Geometries `.2dms` and
    `.a2dms` are not supported in this mode.

`.grad` (lod gradient)
:   Requires two `.f32` vectors, `dPdx` and `dPdy`, that specify the partials. The vectors are
    singletons for 1d and a1d textures; are two-element vectors for 2d and a2d textures; and are
    four-element vectors for 3d, cube and acube textures, where the fourth element is ignored for 3d
    and cube geometries. Geometries `.2dms` and `.a2dms` are not supported in this mode.

For mipmap texture lookup, an optional operand `e` may be specified. Operand `e` is a vector of
`.s32` that specifies coordinate offset. Offset is applied to coordinates before doing texture
lookup. Offset value is in the range of -8 to +7. Offset vector operand is not supported for cube
and cubemap geometries.

An optional operand `f` may be specified for mipmap textures. Operand `f` is `.f32` scalar
value that specifies depth compare value for depth textures. When using depth compare operand, the
coordinates in texture coordinate vector `c` have `.f32` type.

The optional destination predicate `p` is set to `True` if data from texture at specified
coordinates is resident in memory, `False` otherwise. When optional destination predicate `p` is
set to `False`, data loaded will be all zeros. Memory residency of Texture Data at specified
coordinates is dependent on execution environment setup using Driver API calls, prior to kernel
launch. Refer to Driver API documentation for more details including any system/implementation
specific behavior.

Depth compare operand is not supported for `3d` textures.
