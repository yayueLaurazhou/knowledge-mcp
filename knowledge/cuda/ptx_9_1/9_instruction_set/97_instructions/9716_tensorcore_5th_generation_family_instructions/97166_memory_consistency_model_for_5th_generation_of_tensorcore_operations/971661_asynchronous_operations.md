# 9.7.16.6.1. Asynchronous Operations

##### 9.7.16.6.1. [Asynchronous Operations](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#tcgen05-memory-consistency-model-async-operations)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#tcgen05-memory-consistency-model-async-operations "Permalink to this headline")

The tcgen05 family of instructions are divided into 2 categories:

1. Asynchronous instructions:

   These `tcgen05` operations are not inherently ordered with respect to
   other `tcgen05` operations in the same thread (unless pipelined as mentioned below).
2. Synchronous instructions:

   These `tcgen05` operations are inherently ordered with respect to other `tcgen05`
   operations in the same order.

   The Tensor Memory allocation related instructions that access shared memory maintain
   same-address ordering with respect to non-`tcgen05` instructions.

The following table lists the category of each of the `tcgen05` instruction:

| tcgen05.\* operation | Category |
| --- | --- |
| `.alloc` | Synchronous  instructions |
| `.dealloc` |
| `.relinquish_alloc_permit` |
| `.fence::*` |
| `.wait::*` |
| `.commit` |
| `.mma` | Asynchronous  instructions |
| `.cp` |
| `.shift` |
| `.ld` |
| `.st` |
