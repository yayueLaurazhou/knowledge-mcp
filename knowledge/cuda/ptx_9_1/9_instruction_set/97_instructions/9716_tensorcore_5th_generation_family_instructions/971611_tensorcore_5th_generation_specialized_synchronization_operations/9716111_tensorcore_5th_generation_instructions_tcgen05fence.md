##### 9.7.16.11.1. [TensorCore 5th Generation Instructions: `tcgen05.fence`](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#tcgen05-special-sync-operations-fence)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#tcgen05-special-sync-operations-fence "Permalink to this headline")

`tcgen05.fence`

Specialized fence for the asynchronous tcgen05 operations.

Syntax

```
tcgen05.fence::before_thread_sync ;
tcgen05.fence::after_thread_sync  ;
```

Description

The instruction `tcgen05.fence::before_thread_sync` orders all the prior asynchronous
`tcgen05` operations with respect to the subsequent `tcgen05` and the execution
ordering operations.

The instruction `tcgen05.fence::after_thread_sync` orders all the subsequent asynchronous
`tcgen05` operations with respect to the prior `tcgen05` and the execution ordering
operations.

The `tcgen05.fence::*` instructions compose with execution ordering instructions across
a thread scope and provide ordering between `tcgen05` instructions across the same scope.

The `tcgen05.fence::before_thread_sync` instructions behave as code motion fence for prior
`tcgen05` instructions as they cannot be hoisted across. The `tcgen05.fence::after_thread_sync`
instructions behave as code motion fence for subsequent `tcgen05` instructions as they cannot
be hoisted across.

PTX ISA Notes

Introduced in PTX ISA version 8.6.

Target ISA Notes

Supported on following architectures:

* `sm_100a`
* `sm_101a` (Renamed to `sm_110a` from PTX ISA version 9.0)
* And is supported on following family-specific architectures from PTX ISA version 8.8:

  + `sm_100f` or higher in the same family
  + `sm_101f` or higher in the same family (Renamed to `sm_110f` from PTX ISA version 9.0)
* `sm_110f` or higher in the same family
