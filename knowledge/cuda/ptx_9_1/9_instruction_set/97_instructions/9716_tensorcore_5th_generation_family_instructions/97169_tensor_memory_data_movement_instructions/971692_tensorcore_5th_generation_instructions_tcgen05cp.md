Description

Instruction `tcgen05.cp` initiates an asynchronous copy operation from shared memory to the
location specified by the address operand `taddr` in the [Tensor Memory](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#tensor-memory).

The 64-bit register operand `s-desc` is the matrix descriptor which represents the source
matrix in the shared memory that needs to be copied. The format of the matrix descriptor is
described in [Matrix Descriptors](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#tcgen05-matrix-descriptors).

The `.shape` qualifier indicates the dimension of data to be copied as described in the
[Data Movement Shape](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#tcgen05-data-movement-shape).

Qualifier `.cta_group` specifies the number of CTAs whose [Tensor Memory](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#tensor-memory) is
accessed when a single thread of a single CTA executes the `tcgen05.cp` instruction.
When `.cta_group::1` is specified, the data is copied into the [Tensor Memory](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#tensor-memory)
of the current CTA. When `.cta_group::2` is specified, the data is copied into the
[Tensor Memory](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#tensor-memory) of both the current and the [peer CTAs](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#tcgen05-peer-cta).

All `tcgen05` instructions within a kernel must specify the same value for the `.cta_group`
qualifier.

When the qualifiers `.dst_fmt` and `.src_fmt` are specified, the data is decompressed
from the source format `.src_fmt` in the shared memory to the destination format
`.dst_fmt` in [Tensor Memory](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#tensor-memory) by the copy operation. The details of source
and the destination formats as specified in the section
[Optional Decompression](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#tcgen05-optional-decompression).

Some of the `.shape` qualifiers require certain `.multicast` qualifiers.

1. `.64x128b` requires `.warpx2::02_13` or `.warpx2::01_23`
2. `.32x128b` requires `.warpx4`

When the `.multicast` qualifier is specified as either `.warpx2::02_13` or
`.warpx2::01_23` then the data being copied is multicasted into warp pairs and each
warp in the warp pair receive half of the data. Warp pairs are formed as follows:

1. `.warpx2::02_13` : warps 0 and 2 form a pair; warps 1 and 3 form a pair.
2. `.warpx2::01_23` : warps 0 and 1 form a pair; warps 2 and 3 form a pair.

When the `.multicast` modifier is specified as `.warpx4` then the data being
copied is multicasted into all 4 warps.
