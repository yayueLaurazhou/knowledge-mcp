# 9.7.16.10. TensorCore 5th Generation Matrix Multiply and accumulate Operations

#### 9.7.16.10. [TensorCore 5th Generation Matrix Multiply and accumulate Operations](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#tcgen05-mma)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#tcgen05-mma "Permalink to this headline")

The 5th generation of TensorCore operations of shape *MxNxK* perform matrix
multiplication and accumulation of the form:

`D = A*B+D`

where:

* the `A` matrix has shape *MxK*, in either Tensor Memory or Shared Memory
* the `B` matrix has shape *KxN*, in Shared Memory of the current CTA and optionally in peer CTA
* the `D` matrix is of the shape *MxN*, in Tensor Memory

Optionally an input predicate can be used to disable the input from the accumulator
matrix and the following operation can be performed as

`D = A*B`

The matrix multiplication and accumulation operations are categorized into various kinds
based on input types and the throughput of the multiplication operation. The following shows the
different kinds of MMA operations that are supported:

1. `f16` : supports `f16` and `bf16` input types.
2. `tf32` : supports `tf32` input types.
3. `f8f6f4` : supports all input combinations of `f8`, `f6` and `f4` types.
4. `i8` : supports signed and unsigned 8-bit integer input types.
5. `mxf8f6f4`/`mxf4` : supports mx-floating points input types.
6. `mxf4nvf4` : supports `mxf4` type and a custom NVIDIA floating-point
   type for inputs where the type of the vector elements is 4 bits and requires a common
   scaling factor to form the complete floating-point type, similar to other mx-types.

Optionally, the 5th generation of TensorCore MMAs support dense and sparse matrix `A`.
[Sparse Matrices](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#tcgen05-sparse-matrices) describes the details of the sparse matrices.

Some of the MMA-kinds requires scaling of input matrices from memory to form the matrix
`A` and matrix `B` before performing the MMA operation.
[Block Scaling for tcgen05.mma.sync](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#tcgen05-block-scaling) describes the details of the scaling of matrices.

The following table show the various matrices involved in the MMA operations and the memory in
which they can reside:

| Matrix Type | Memory |
| --- | --- |
| `A` | Tensor Memory OR Shared Memory |
| `B` | Shared Memory |
| `D` | Tensor Memory |
| `Sparse Meta Data` |
| `A-Scale` / `B-Scale` |

A sequence of MMA instructions may reuse the same `A` matrix with a sequence of `B`
matrices or may reuse the same `B` matrix with a sequence of `A` matrices.
In these patterns the TensorCore may be able to laod the unchanged matrix once and reuse
it through the sequence without multiple reloads. The `A` or `B` matrices are loaded
into a TensorCore collector buffer (i.e., special cache).

An MMA instruction has an optional `collector` qualifier to specify when an `A` or `B`
matrix is new to the sequence and should be loaded, unchanged within the sequence
and should be reused, or the last use in the sequence and should be discarded.
The `collector` qualifier is used to give the TensorCore permission to reuse a previously
loaded `A` or `B` matrix; however reuse is opportunistic in that the TensorCore may
reload a matrix even when it has permission to reuse that matrix. Thus, the source
memory of an `A` or `B` matrix must not be modified while the MMA instruction using those
matrices has not completed - regardless of `collector` qualifier permissions.

The 5th generation of TensorCore MMAs can be used for general matrix multiplication OR for
convolution operations. In case of convolutions, the activations can be stored in either
matrix `A` or matrix `B` while the weights will be stored in the other matrix.

| Activation Matrix | Weights Matrix | Name of the op | Instruction Name | Collector Buffer Applicability |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `A` | `B` | Activation Stationary | (default `tcgen05.mma`) | Collector buffer is applicable on matrix `A` |
| `B` | `A` | Weights Stationary | `.ws` | Collector buffer is applicable on matrix `B` |
