Description

The instruction `tcgen05.commit` is an asynchronous instruction which makes the mbarrier object,
specified by the address operand `mbar`, track the completion of all the prior asynchronous
`tcgen05` operations, as listed in
[mbarrier based completion mechanism](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#tcgen05-memory-consistency-model-mbarrier-completion),
initiated by the executing thread. Upon the completion of the tracked asynchronous `tcgen05`
operations, the signal specified by the `.completion_mechanism` is triggered by the system
on the mbarrier object.
This instruction accesses its `mbarrier` operand using generic-proxy.

The instruction `tcgen05.commit.cta_group::1` tracks for the completion of all prior
asynchronous `tcgen05` operations with `.cta_group::1` issued by the current thread.
Similarly, the instruction `tcgen05.commit.cta_group::2` tracks for the completion of all
prior asynchronous `tcgen05` operations with `.cta_group::2` issued by the current thread.

All `tcgen05` instructions within a kernel must specify the same value for the `.cta_group`
qualifier.

The qualifier `.mbarrier::arrive::one` indicates that upon the completion of the prior
asynchronous `tcgen05` operation issued by the current thread, an arrive-on operation, with
the count argument of 1, is signaled on the mbarrier object. The scope of the arrive-on operation
is the cluster scope.

The optional qualifier `.multicast::cluster` allows signaling on the mbarrier objects of multiple
CTAs in the cluster. Operand `ctaMask` specifies the CTAs in the cluster such that each bit
position in the 16-bit `ctaMask` operand corresponds to the `%cluster_ctarank` of the destination
CTA. The mbarrier signal is multicast to the same offset as `mbar` in the shared memory of each
destination CTA.

If no state space is specified then [Generic Addressing](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#generic-addressing) is used. If the
address specified by `mbar` does not fall within the address window of `.shared::cluster` state
space then the behavior is undefined.
