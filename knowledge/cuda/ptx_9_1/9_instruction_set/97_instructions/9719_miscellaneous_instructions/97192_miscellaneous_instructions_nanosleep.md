# 9.7.19.2. Miscellaneous Instructions: nanosleep

#### 9.7.19.2. [Miscellaneous Instructions: `nanosleep`](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#miscellaneous-instructions-nanosleep)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#miscellaneous-instructions-nanosleep "Permalink to this headline")

`nanosleep`

Suspend the thread for an approximate delay given in nanoseconds.

Syntax

```
nanosleep.u32 t;
```

Copy to clipboard

Description

Suspends the thread for a sleep duration approximately close to the delay `t`, specified in
nanoseconds. `t` may be a register or an immediate value.

The sleep duration is approximated, but guaranteed to be in the interval `[0, 2*t]`. The maximum
sleep duration is 1 millisecond. The implementation may reduce the sleep duration for individual
threads within a warp such that all sleeping threads in the warp wake up together.

PTX ISA Notes

`nanosleep` introduced in PTX ISA 6.3.

Target ISA Notes

`nanosleep` requires `sm_70` or higher.

Examples
