# 9.6.1. Machine-Specific Semantics of 16-bit Code

### 9.6.1. [Machine-Specific Semantics of 16-bit Code](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#machine-specific-semantics-of-16-bit-code)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#machine-specific-semantics-of-16-bit-code "Permalink to this headline")

A PTX program may execute on a GPU with either a 16-bit or a 32-bit data path. When executing on a
32-bit data path, 16-bit registers in PTX are mapped to 32-bit physical registers, and 16-bit
computations are *promoted* to 32-bit computations. This can lead to computational differences
between code run on a 16-bit machine versus the same code run on a 32-bit machine, since the
promoted computation may have bits in the high-order half-word of registers that are not present in
16-bit physical registers. These extra precision bits can become visible at the application level,
for example, by a right-shift instruction.

At the PTX language level, one solution would be to define semantics for 16-bit code that is
consistent with execution on a 16-bit data path. This approach introduces a performance penalty for
16-bit code executing on a 32-bit data path, since the translated code would require many additional
masking instructions to suppress extra precision bits in the high-order half-word of 32-bit
registers.

Rather than introduce a performance penalty for 16-bit code running on 32-bit GPUs, the semantics of
16-bit instructions in PTX is machine-specific. A compiler or programmer may chose to enforce
portable, machine-independent 16-bit semantics by adding explicit conversions to 16-bit values at
appropriate points in the program to guarantee portability of the code. However, for many
performance-critical applications, this is not desirable, and for many applications the difference
in execution is preferable to limiting performance.
