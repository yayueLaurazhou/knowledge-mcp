Threads in a CTA execute together, at least in appearance, until they come to a conditional control
construct such as a conditional branch, conditional function call, or conditional return. If threads
execute down different control flow paths, the threads are called *divergent*. If all of the threads
act in unison and follow a single control flow path, the threads are called *uniform*. Both
situations occur often in programs.

A CTA with divergent threads may have lower performance than a CTA with uniformly executing threads,
so it is important to have divergent threads re-converge as soon as possible. All control constructs
are assumed to be divergent points unless the control-flow instruction is marked as uniform, using
the `.uni` suffix. For divergent control flow, the optimizing code generator automatically
determines points of re-convergence. Therefore, a compiler or code author targeting PTX can ignore
the issue of divergent threads, but has the opportunity to improve performance by marking branch
points as uniform when the compiler or author can guarantee that the branch point is non-divergent.
