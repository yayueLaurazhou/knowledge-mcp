Description

The `"used_bytes_mask" pragma` is a directive that specifies used bytes in a load
operation based on the mask provided.

`"used_bytes_mask" pragma` needs to be specified prior to a load instruction for which
information about bytes used from the load operation is needed.
Pragma is ignored if instruction following it is not a load instruction.

For a load instruction without this pragma, all bytes from the load operation are assumed
to be used.

Operand `mask` is a 32-bit integer with set bits indicating the used bytes in data of
load operation.

Semantics

```
Each bit in mask operand corresponds to a byte data where each set bit represents the used byte.
Most-significant bit corresponds to most-significant byte of data.

// For 4 bytes load with only lower 3 bytes used
.pragma "used_bytes_mask 0x7";
ld.global.u32 %r0, [gbl];     // Higher 1 byte from %r0 is unused

// For vector load of 16 bytes with lower 12 bytes used
.pragma "used_bytes_mask 0xfff";
ld.global.v4.u32 {%r0, %r1, %r2, %r3}, [gbl];  // %r3 unused
