Description

The `"frequency" pragma` is a directive that specifies the number of times a basic block is
executed by an executing thread. The optimizing compiler backend treats this pragma as a hint
which will be used for optimizations.

Operand `n` is a 64-bit non-negative integer constant that specifies the execution frequency.

Note that in order to have the desired effect of this pragma, it should be specified at the start of
the basic block. Basic block is defined as a straight-line sequence of instructions with only one
entry point and one exit point.
