Description

The `"nounroll" pragma` is a directive to disable loop unrolling in the optimizing backend
compiler.

The `"nounroll" pragma` is allowed at module, entry-function, and statement levels, with the
following meanings:

module scope
:   disables unrolling for all loops in module, including loops preceding the `.pragma`.

entry-function scope
:   disables unrolling for all loops in the entry function body.

statement-level pragma
:   disables unrolling of the loop for which the current block is the loop header.

Note that in order to have the desired effect at statement level, the `"nounroll"` directive must
appear before any instruction statements in the loop header basic block for the desired loop. The
loop header block is defined as the block that dominates all blocks in the loop body and is the
target of the loop backedge. Statement-level `"nounroll"` directives appearing outside of loop
header blocks are silently ignored.

PTX ISA Notes
