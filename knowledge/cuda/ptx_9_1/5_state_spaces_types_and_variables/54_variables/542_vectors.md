# 5.4.2. Vectors

### 5.4.2. [Vectors](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#vectors)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#vectors "Permalink to this headline")

Limited-length vector types are supported. Vectors of length 2 and 4 of any non-predicate
fundamental type can be declared by prefixing the type with `.v2` or `.v4`. Vectors must be
based on a fundamental type, and they may reside in the register space. Vectors cannot exceed
128-bits in length; for example, `.v4 .f64` is not allowed. Three-element vectors may be
handled by using a `.v4` vector, where the fourth element provides padding. This is a common case
for three-dimensional grids, textures, etc.

Examples

```
.global .v4 .f32 V;   // a length-4 vector of floats
.shared .v2 .u16 uv;  // a length-2 vector of unsigned ints
.global .v4 .b8  v;   // a length-4 vector of bytes
```

By default, vector variables are aligned to a multiple of their overall size (vector length times
base-type size), to enable vector load and store instructions which require addresses aligned to a
multiple of the access size.
