# 5.4.5. Alignment

### 5.4.5. [Alignment](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#alignment)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#alignment "Permalink to this headline")

Byte alignment of storage for all addressable variables can be specified in the variable
declaration. Alignment is specified using an optional `.align` *byte-count* specifier immediately
following the state-space specifier. The variable will be aligned to an address which is an integer
multiple of byte-count. The alignment value byte-count must be a power of two. For arrays, alignment
specifies the address alignment for the starting address of the entire array, not for individual
elements.

The default alignment for scalar and array variables is to a multiple of the base-type size. The
default alignment for vector variables is to a multiple of the overall vector size.

Examples

```
 // allocate array at 4-byte aligned address.  Elements are bytes.
.const .align 4 .b8 bar[8] = {0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0};
```

Note that all PTX instructions that access memory require that the address be aligned to a multiple
of the access size. The access size of a memory instruction is the total number of bytes accessed in
memory. For example, the access size of `ld.v4.b32` is 16 bytes, while the access size of
`atom.f16x2` is 4 bytes.
