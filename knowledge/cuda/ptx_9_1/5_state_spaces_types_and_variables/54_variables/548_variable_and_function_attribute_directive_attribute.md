# 5.4.8. Variable and Function Attribute Directive: .attribute

### 5.4.8. [Variable and Function Attribute Directive: `.attribute`](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#variable-and-function-attribute-directive-attribute)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#variable-and-function-attribute-directive-attribute "Permalink to this headline")

`.attribute`

Variable and function attributes

Description

Used to specify special attributes of a variable or a function.

The following attributes are supported.

`.managed`
:   `.managed` attribute specifies that variable will be allocated at a location in unified virtual
    memory environment where host and other devices in the system can reference the variable
    directly. This attribute can only be used with variables in .global state space. See the *CUDA
    UVM-Lite Programming Guide* for details.

`.unified`
:   `.unified` attribute specifies that function has the same memory address on the host and on
    other devices in the system. Integer constants `uuid1` and `uuid2` respectively specify upper
    and lower 64 bits of the unique identifier associated with the function or the variable. This
    attribute can only be used on device functions or on variables in the `.global` state
    space. Variables with `.unified` attribute are read-only and must be loaded by specifying
    `.unified` qualifier on the address operand of `ld` instruction, otherwise the behavior is
    undefined.

PTX ISA Notes

* Introduced in PTX ISA version 4.0.
* Support for function attributes introduced in PTX ISA version 8.0.

Target ISA Notes

* `.managed` attribute requires `sm_30` or higher.
* `.unified` attribute requires `sm_90` or higher.

Examples

```
.global .attribute(.managed) .s32 g;
.global .attribute(.managed) .u64 x;

.global .attribute(.unified(19,95)) .f32 f;

.func .attribute(.unified(0xAB, 0xCD)) bar() { ... }
```
