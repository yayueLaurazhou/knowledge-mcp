# 5.5. Tensors

## 5.5. [Tensors](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#tensors)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#tensors "Permalink to this headline")

A tensor is a multi-dimensional matrix structure in the memory. Tensor is defined by the following
properties:

* Dimensionality
* Dimension sizes across each dimension
* Individual element types
* Tensor stride across each dimension

PTX supports instructions which can operate on the tensor data. PTX Tensor instructions include:

* Copying data between global and shared memories
* Reducing the destination tensor data with the source.

The Tensor data can be operated on by various `wmma.mma`, `mma` and `wgmma.mma_async`
instructions.

PTX Tensor instructions treat the tensor data in the global memory as a multi-dimensional structure
and treat the data in the shared memory as a linear data.
