# 5.5.6. Interleave layout

### 5.5.6. [Interleave layout](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#tensor-interleaved-layout)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#tensor-interleaved-layout "Permalink to this headline")

Tensor can be interleaved and the following interleave layouts are supported:

* No interleave (NDHWC)
* 8 byte interleave (NC/8DHWC8) : C8 utilizes 16 bytes in memory assuming 2B per channel.
* 16 byte interleave (NC/16HWC16) : C16 utilizes 32 bytes in memory assuming 4B per channel.

The *C* information is organized in slices where sequential C elements are grouped in 16 byte or 32
byte quantities.

If the total number of channels is not a multiple of the number of channels per slice, then the last
slice must be padded with zeros to make it complete 16B or 32B slice.

Interleaved layouts are supported only for the dimensionalities : 3D, 4D and 5D.

The interleave layout is not supported for `.im2col::w` and `.im2col::w::128` modes.
