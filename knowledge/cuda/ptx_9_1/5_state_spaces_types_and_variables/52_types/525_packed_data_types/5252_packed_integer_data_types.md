# 5.2.5.2. Packed Integer Data Types

#### 5.2.5.2. [Packed Integer Data Types](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#packed-integer-data-types)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#packed-integer-data-types "Permalink to this headline")

PTX supports two variants of packed integer data types: `.u16x2` and `.s16x2`. The packed data
type consists of two `.u16` or `.s16` values. A register variable containing `.u16x2` or
`.s16x2` data must be declared with `.b32` type. Packed integer data types cannot be used as
fundamental types. They are supported as instruction types on certain instructions.
