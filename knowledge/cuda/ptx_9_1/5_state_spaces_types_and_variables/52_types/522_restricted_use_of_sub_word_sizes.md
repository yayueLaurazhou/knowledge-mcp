# 5.2.2. Restricted Use of Sub-Word Sizes

### 5.2.2. [Restricted Use of Sub-Word Sizes](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#restricted-use-of-sub-word-sizes)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#restricted-use-of-sub-word-sizes "Permalink to this headline")

The `.u8`, `.s8`, and `.b8` instruction types are restricted to `ld`, `st`, and `cvt`
instructions. The `.f16` floating-point type is allowed only in conversions to and from `.f32`,
`.f64` types, in half precision floating point instructions and texture fetch instructions. The
`.f16x2` floating point type is allowed only in half precision floating point arithmetic
instructions and texture fetch instructions.

For convenience, `ld`, `st`, and `cvt` instructions permit source and destination data
operands to be wider than the instruction-type size, so that narrow values may be loaded, stored,
and converted using regular-width registers. For example, 8-bit or 16-bit values may be held
directly in 32-bit or 64-bit registers when being loaded, stored, or converted to other types and
sizes.
