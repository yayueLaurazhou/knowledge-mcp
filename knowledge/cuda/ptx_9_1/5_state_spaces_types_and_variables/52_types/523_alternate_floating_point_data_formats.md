# 5.2.3. Alternate Floating-Point Data Formats

### 5.2.3. [Alternate Floating-Point Data Formats](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#alternate-floating-point-data-formats)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#alternate-floating-point-data-formats "Permalink to this headline")

The fundamental floating-point types supported in PTX have implicit bit representations that
indicate the number of bits used to store exponent and mantissa. For example, the `.f16` type
indicates 5 bits reserved for exponent and 10 bits reserved for mantissa. In addition to the
floating-point representations assumed by the fundamental types, PTX allows the following alternate
floating-point data formats:

`bf16` data format:
:   This data format is a 16-bit floating point format with 8 bits for exponent and 7 bits for
    mantissa. A register variable containing `bf16` data must be declared with `.b16` type.

`e4m3` data format:
:   This data format is an 8-bit floating point format with 4 bits for exponent and 3 bits for
    mantissa. The `e4m3` encoding does not support infinity and `NaN` values are limited to
    `0x7f` and `0xff`. A register variable containing `e4m3` value must be declared using
    bit-size type.

`e5m2` data format:
:   This data format is an 8-bit floating point format with 5 bits for exponent and 2 bits for
    mantissa. A register variable containing `e5m2` value must be declared using bit-size type.

`tf32` data format:
:   This data format is a special 32-bit floating point format supported by the matrix
    multiply-and-accumulate instructions, with the same range as `.f32` and reduced precision (>=10
    bits). The internal layout of `tf32` format is implementation defined. PTX facilitates
    conversion from single precision `.f32` type to `tf32` format. A register variable containing
    `tf32` data must be declared with `.b32` type.

`e2m1` data format:
:   This data format is a 4-bit floating point format with 2 bits for exponent and 1 bit for mantissa.
    The `e2m1` encoding does not support infinity and `NaN`. `e2m1` values must be used in a
    packed format specified as `e2m1x2`. A register variable containing two `e2m1` values must be
    declared with `.b8` type.

`e2m3` data format:
:   This data format is a 6-bit floating point format with 2 bits for exponent and 3 bits for mantissa.
    The `e2m3` encoding does not support infinity and `NaN`. `e2m3` values must be used in a
    packed format specified as `e2m3x2`. A register variable containing two `e2m3` values must be
    declared with `.b16` type where each `.b8` element has 6-bit floating point value and 2 MSB
    bits padded with zeros.

`e3m2` data format:
:   This data format is a 6-bit floating point format with 3 bits for exponent and 2 bits for mantissa.
    The `e3m2` encoding does not support infinity and `NaN`. `e3m2` values must be used in a
    packed format specified as `e3m2x2`. A register variable containing two `e3m2` values must be
    declared with `.b16` type where each `.b8` element has 6-bit floating point value and 2 MSB
    bits padded with zeros.

`ue8m0` data format:
:   This data format is an 8-bit unsigned floating-point format with 8 bits for exponent and 0 bits for
    mantissa. The `ue8m0` encoding does not support infinity. `NaN` value is limited to `0xff`.
    `ue8m0` values must be used in a packed format specified as `ue8m0x2`. A register variable
    containing two `ue8m0` values must be declared with `.b16` type.

`ue4m3` data format:
:   This data format is a 7-bit unsigned floating-point format with 4 bits for exponent and 3 bits for
    mantissa. The `ue4m3` encoding does not support infinity. `NaN` value is limited to `0x7f`.
    A register variable containing single `ue4m3` value must be declared with `.b8` type having
    MSB bit padded with zero.

Alternate data formats cannot be used as fundamental types. They are supported as source or
destination formats by certain instructions.
