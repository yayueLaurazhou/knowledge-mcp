# 5.1.5. Local State Space

### 5.1.5. [Local State Space](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#local-state-space)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#local-state-space "Permalink to this headline")

The local state space (`.local`) is private memory for each thread to keep its own data. It is
typically standard memory with cache. The size is limited, as it must be allocated on a per-thread
basis. Use `ld.local` and `st.local` to access local variables.

When compiling to use the *Application Binary Interface (ABI)*, `.local` state-space variables
must be declared within function scope and are allocated on the stack. In implementations that do
not support a stack, all local memory variables are stored at fixed addresses, recursive function
calls are not supported, and `.local` variables may be declared at module scope. When compiling
legacy PTX code (ISA versions prior to 3.0) containing module-scoped `.local` variables, the
compiler silently disables use of the ABI.
