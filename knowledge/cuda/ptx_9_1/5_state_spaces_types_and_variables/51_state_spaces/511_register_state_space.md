# 5.1.1. Register State Space

### 5.1.1. [Register State Space](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#register-state-space)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#register-state-space "Permalink to this headline")

Registers (`.reg` state space) are fast storage locations. The number of registers is limited, and
will vary from platform to platform. When the limit is exceeded, register variables will be spilled
to memory, causing changes in performance. For each architecture, there is a recommended maximum
number of registers to use (see the *CUDA Programming Guide* for details).

Registers may be typed (signed integer, unsigned integer, floating point, predicate) or
untyped. Register size is restricted; aside from predicate registers which are 1-bit, scalar
registers have a width of 8-, 16-, 32-, 64-, or 128-bits, and vector registers have a width of
16-, 32-, 64-, or 128-bits. The most common use of 8-bit registers is with `ld`, `st`, and `cvt`
instructions, or as elements of vector tuples.

Registers differ from the other state spaces in that they are not fully addressable, i.e., it is not
possible to refer to the address of a register. When compiling to use the Application Binary
Interface (ABI), register variables are restricted to function scope and may not be declared at
module scope. When compiling legacy PTX code (ISA versions prior to 3.0) containing module-scoped
`.reg` variables, the compiler silently disables use of the ABI. Registers may have alignment
boundaries required by multi-word loads and stores.
