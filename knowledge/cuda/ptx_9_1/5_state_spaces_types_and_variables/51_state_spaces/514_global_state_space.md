# 5.1.4. Global State Space

### 5.1.4. [Global State Space](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#global-state-space)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#global-state-space "Permalink to this headline")

The global (`.global`) state space is memory that is accessible by all threads in a context. It is
the mechanism by which threads in different CTAs, clusters, and grids can communicate. Use
`ld.global`, `st.global`, and `atom.global` to access global variables.

Global variables have an optional variable initializer; global variables with no explicit
initializer are initialized to zero by default.
