# 5.1.3.1. Banked Constant State Space (deprecated)

#### 5.1.3.1. [Banked Constant State Space (deprecated)](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#banked-constant-state-space-deprecated)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#banked-constant-state-space-deprecated "Permalink to this headline")

Previous versions of PTX exposed constant memory as a set of eleven 64 KB banks, with explicit bank
numbers required for variable declaration and during access.

Prior to PTX ISA version 2.2, the constant memory was organized into fixed size banks. There were
eleven 64 KB banks, and banks were specified using the `.const[bank]` modifier, where *bank*
ranged from 0 to 10. If no bank number was given, bank zero was assumed.

By convention, bank zero was used for all statically-sized constant variables. The remaining banks
were used to declare *incomplete* constant arrays (as in C, for example), where the size is not
known at compile time. For example, the declaration

```
.extern .const[2] .b32 const_buffer[];
```

resulted in `const_buffer` pointing to the start of constant bank two. This pointer could then be
used to access the entire 64 KB constant bank. Multiple incomplete array variables declared in the
same bank were aliased, with each pointing to the start address of the specified constant bank.

To access data in contant banks 1 through 10, the bank number was required in the state space of the
load instruction. For example, an incomplete array in bank 2 was accessed as follows:

```
.extern .const[2] .b32 const_buffer[];
ld.const[2].b32  %r1, [const_buffer+4]; // load second word
```

In PTX ISA version 2.2, we eliminated explicit banks and replaced the incomplete array
representation of driver-allocated constant buffers with kernel parameter attributes that allow
pointers to constant buffers to be passed as kernel parameters.
