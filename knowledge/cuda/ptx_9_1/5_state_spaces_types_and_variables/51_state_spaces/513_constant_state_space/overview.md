# 5.1.3. Constant State Space

### 5.1.3. [Constant State Space](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#constant-state-space)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#constant-state-space "Permalink to this headline")

The constant (`.const`) state space is a read-only memory initialized by the host. Constant memory
is accessed with a `ld.const` instruction. Constant memory is restricted in size, currently
limited to 64 KB which can be used to hold statically-sized constant variables. There is an
additional 640 KB of constant memory, organized as ten independent 64 KB regions. The driver may
allocate and initialize constant buffers in these regions and pass pointers to the buffers as kernel
function parameters. Since the ten regions are not contiguous, the driver must ensure that constant
buffers are allocated so that each buffer fits entirely within a 64 KB region and does not span a
region boundary.

Statically-sized constant variables have an optional variable initializer; constant variables with
no explicit initializer are initialized to zero by default. Constant buffers allocated by the driver
are initialized by the host, and pointers to such buffers are passed to the kernel as
parameters. See the description of kernel parameter attributes in
[Kernel Function Parameter Attributes](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#kernel-function-parameter-attributes) for more details on passing pointers
to constant buffers as kernel parameters.
