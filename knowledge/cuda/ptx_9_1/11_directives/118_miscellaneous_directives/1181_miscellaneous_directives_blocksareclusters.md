# 11.8.1. Miscellaneous Directives: .blocksareclusters

### 11.8.1. [Miscellaneous Directives: `.blocksareclusters`](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#miscellaneous-directives-blocksareclusters)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#miscellaneous-directives-blocksareclusters "Permalink to this headline")

`.blocksareclusters`

Specify that CUDA thread blocks are mapped to clusters.

Syntax

```
.blocksareclusters

Description

Default behavior of CUDA API is to specify the grid launch configuration by specifying the number of
thread blocks and the number of threads per block.

When `.blocksareclusters` directive is specified, it implies that the grid launch configuration
for the corresponding `.entry` function is specifying the number of clusters, i.e. the launch
configuration is specifying number of clusters instead of the number of thread blocks. In this case,
the number of thread blocks per cluster is specified by `.reqnctapercluster` directive and the
thread block size is specified with the `.reqntid` directive.

`.blocksareclusters` directive is only allowed for `.entry` functions and also needs
`.reqntid` and `.reqnctapercluster` directives to be specified.

Refer to *CUDA Programming Guide* for more details.

PTX ISA Notes

Introduced in PTX ISA version 9.0.
