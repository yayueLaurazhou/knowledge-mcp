Description

Associates a source filename with an integer index. `.loc` directives reference source files by
index.

`.file` directive allows optionally specifying an unsigned number representing time of last
modification and an unsigned integer representing size in bytes of source file. `timestamp` and
`file_size` value can be 0 to indicate this information is not available.

`timestamp` value is in format of C and C++ data type `time_t`.

`file_size` is an unsigned 64-bit integer.

The `.file` directive is allowed only in the outermost scope, i.e., at the same level as kernel
and device function declarations.

Semantics

If timestamp and file size are not specified, they default to 0.

PTX ISA Notes

Introduced in PTX ISA version 1.0.

Timestamp and file size introduced in PTX ISA version 3.2.

Target ISA Notes

Supported on all target architectures.

Examples

```
.file 1 "example.cu"
.file 2 "kernel.cu"
