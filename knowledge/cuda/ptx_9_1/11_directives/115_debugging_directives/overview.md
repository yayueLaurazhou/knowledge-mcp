DWARF-format debug information is passed through PTX modules using the following directives:

* `@@DWARF`
* `.section`
* `.file`
* `.loc`

The `.section` directive was introduced in PTX ISA version 2.0 and replaces the `@@DWARF`
syntax. The `@@DWARF` syntax was deprecated in PTX ISA version 2.0 but is supported for legacy PTX
ISA version 1.x code.

Beginning with PTX ISA version 3.0, PTX files containing DWARF debug information should include the
`.target debug` platform option. This forward declaration directs PTX compilation to retain
mappings for source-level debugging.
