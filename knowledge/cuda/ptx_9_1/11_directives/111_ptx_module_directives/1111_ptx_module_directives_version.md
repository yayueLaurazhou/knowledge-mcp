Description

Specifies the PTX language version number.

The *major* number is incremented when there are incompatible changes to the PTX language, such as
changes to the syntax or semantics. The version major number is used by the PTX compiler to ensure
correct execution of legacy PTX code.

The *minor* number is incremented when new features are added to PTX.

Semantics

Indicates that this module must be compiled with tools that support an equal or greater version
number.

Each PTX module must begin with a `.version` directive, and no other `.version` directive is
allowed anywhere else within the module.

PTX ISA Notes

Introduced in PTX ISA version 1.0.

Target ISA Notes

Supported on all target architectures.

Examples

```
.version 3.1
.version 3.0
.version 2.3
