# 11.1.3. PTX Module Directives: .address_size

### 11.1.3. [PTX Module Directives: `.address_size`](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#ptx-module-directives-address-size)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#ptx-module-directives-address-size "Permalink to this headline")

`.address_size`

Address size used throughout PTX module.

Syntax

```
.address_size  address-size
address-size = { 32, 64 };
```

Description

Specifies the address size assumed throughout the module by the PTX code and the binary DWARF
information in PTX.

Redefinition of this directive within a module is not allowed. In the presence of separate
compilation all modules must specify (or default to) the same address size.

The `.address_size` directive is optional, but it must immediately follow the `.target`directive if present within a module.

Semantics

If the `.address_size` directive is omitted, the address size defaults to 32.

PTX ISA Notes

Introduced in PTX ISA version 2.3.

Target ISA Notes

Supported on all target architectures.

Examples

```
// example directives
   .address_size 32       // addresses are 32 bit
   .address_size 64       // addresses are 64 bit

// example of directive placement within a module
   .version 2.3
   .target sm_20
   .address_size 64
...
.entry foo () {
...
}
