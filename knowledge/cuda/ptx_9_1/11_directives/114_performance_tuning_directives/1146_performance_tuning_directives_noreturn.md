Description

Indicate that the function does not return to its caller function.

Semantics

An optional `.noreturn` directive indicates that the function does not return to caller
function. `.noreturn` directive can only be specified on device functions and must appear between
a `.func` directive and its body.

The directive cannot be specified on functions which have return parameters.

If a function with `.noreturn` directive returns to the caller function at runtime, then the
behavior is undefined.

PTX ISA Notes

Introduced in PTX ISA version 6.4.

Target ISA Notes

Requires `sm_30` or higher.

Examples

```
.func foo .noreturn { ... }
```
