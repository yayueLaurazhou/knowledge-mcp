`%gridid`

Grid identifier.

Syntax (predefined)

```
.sreg .u64 %gridid;
```

Description

A predefined, read-only special register initialized with the per-grid temporal grid identifier. The
`%gridid` is used by debuggers to distinguish CTAs and clusters within concurrent (small) grids.

During execution, repeated launches of programs may occur, where each launch starts a
grid-of-CTAs. This variable provides the temporal grid launch number for this context.

For `sm_1x` targets, `%gridid` is limited to the range [0..216-1]. For `sm_20`,
`%gridid` is limited to the range [0..232-1]. `sm_30` supports the entire 64-bit range.

PTX ISA Notes

Introduced in PTX ISA version 1.0 as type `.u16`.

Redefined as type `.u32` in PTX ISA version 1.3.

Redefined as type `.u64` in PTX ISA version 3.0.

For compatibility with legacy PTX code, 16-bit and 32-bit `mov` and `cvt` instructions may be
used to read the lower 16-bits or 32-bits of each component of `%gridid`.

Target ISA Notes

Supported on all target architectures.

Examples

```
mov.u64  %s, %gridid;  // 64-bit read of %gridid
mov.u32  %r, %gridid;  // legacy code with 32-bit %gridid
```
