`%total_smem_size`

Total size of shared memory used by a CTA of a kernel.

Syntax (predefined)

```
.sreg .u32 %total_smem_size;
```

Description

A predefined, read-only special register initialized with total size of shared memory allocated
(statically and dynamically, excluding the shared memory reserved for the NVIDIA system software
use) for the CTA of a kernel at launch time.

Size is returned in multiples of shared memory allocation unit size supported by target
architecture.

Allocation unit values are as follows:

| Target architecture | Shared memory allocation unit size |
| --- | --- |
| `sm_2x` | 128 bytes |
| `sm_3x`, `sm_5x`, `sm_6x`, `sm_7x` | 256 bytes |
| `sm_8x`, `sm_9x`, `sm_10x`, `sm_12x` | 128 bytes |

PTX ISA Notes

Introduced in PTX ISA version 4.1.

Target ISA Notes

Requires `sm_20` or higher.

Examples

```
mov.u32  %r, %total_smem_size;
```
