New Features

PTX ISA version 7.8 introduces the following new features:

* Adds support for `sm_89` target architecture.
* Adds support for `sm_90` target architecture.
* Extends `bar` and `barrier` instructions to accept optional scope qualifier `.cta`.
* Extends `.shared` state space qualifier with optional sub-qualifier `::cta`.
* Adds support for `movmatrix` instruction which transposes a matrix in registers across a warp.
* Adds support for `stmatrix` instruction which stores one or more matrices to shared memory.
* Extends the `.f64` floating point type `mma` operation with shapes `.m16n8k4`, `.m16n8k8`,
  and `.m16n8k16`.
* Extends `add`, `sub`, `mul`, `set`, `setp`, `cvt`, `tanh`, `ex2`, `atom` and
  `red` instructions with `bf16` alternate floating point data format.
* Adds support for new alternate floating-point data formats `.e4m3` and `.e5m2`.
* Extends `cvt` instruction to convert `.e4m3` and `.e5m2` alternate floating point data formats.
* Adds support for `griddepcontrol` instruction as a communication mechanism to control the
  execution of dependent grids.
* Extends `mbarrier` instruction to allow a new phase completion check operation *try\_wait*.
* Adds support for new thread scope `.cluster` which is a set of Cooperative Thread Arrays (CTAs).
* Extends `fence`/`membar`, `ld`, `st`, `atom`, and `red` instructions to accept
  `.cluster` scope.
* Adds support for extended visibility of shared state space to all threads within a cluster.
* Extends `.shared` state space qualifier with `::cluster` sub-qualifier for cluster-level
  visibility of shared memory.
* Extends `isspacep`, `cvta`, `ld`, `st`, `atom`, and `red` instructions to accept
  `::cluster` sub-qualifier with `.shared` state space qualifier.
* Adds support for `mapa` instruction to map a shared memory address to the corresponding address
  in a different CTA within the cluster.
* Adds support for `getctarank` instruction to query the rank of the CTA that contains a given
  address.
* Adds support for new barrier synchronization instruction `barrier.cluster`.
* Extends the memory consistency model to include the new cluster scope.
* Adds support for special registers related to cluster information: `%is_explicit_cluster`,
  `%clusterid`, `%nclusterid`, `%cluster_ctaid`, `%cluster_nctaid`, `%cluster_ctarank`,
  `%cluster_nctarank`.
* Adds support for cluster dimension directives `.reqnctapercluster`, `.explicitcluster`, and
  `.maxclusterrank`.
