# 13.9. Changes in PTX ISA Version 8.2

## 13.9. [Changes in PTX ISA Version 8.2](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#changes-in-ptx-isa-version-8-2)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#changes-in-ptx-isa-version-8-2 "Permalink to this headline")

New Features

PTX ISA version 8.2 introduces the following new features:

* Adds support for `.mmio` qualifier on `ld` and `st` instructions.
* Extends `lop3` instruction to allow predicate destination.
* Extends `multimem.ld_reduce` instruction to support `.acc::f32` qualifer to allow `.f32`
  precision of the intermediate accumulation.
* Extends the asynchronous warpgroup-level matrix multiply-and-accumulate operation
  `wgmma.mma_async` to support `.sp` modifier that allows matrix multiply-accumulate operation
  when input matrix A is sparse.

Semantic Changes and Clarifications

The `.multicast::cluster` qualifier on `cp.async.bulk` and `cp.async.bulk.tensor` instructions
is optimized for target architecture `sm_90a` and may have substantially reduced performance on
other targets and hence `.multicast::cluster` is advised to be used with `sm_90a`.
