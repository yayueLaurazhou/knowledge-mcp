New Features

PTX ISA version 8.1 introduces the following new features:

* Adds support for `st.async` and `red.async` instructions for asynchronous store and
  asynchronous reduction operations respectively on shared memory.
* Adds support for `.oob` modifier on half-precision `fma` instruction.
* Adds support for `.satfinite` saturation modifer on `cvt` instruction for `.f16`, `.bf16`
  and `.tf32` formats.
* Extends support for `cvt` with `.e4m3`/`.e5m2` to `sm_89`.
* Extends `atom` and `red` instructions to support vector types.
* Adds support for special register `%aggr_smem_size`.
* Extends `sured` instruction with 64-bit `min`/`max` operations.
* Adds support for increased kernel parameter size of 32764 bytes.
* Adds support for multimem addresses in memory consistency model.
* Adds support for `multimem.ld_reduce`, `multimem.st` and `multimem.red` instructions to
  perform memory operations on multimem addresses.
