New Features

PTX ISA version 7.0 introduces the following new features:

* Support for `sm_80` target architecture.
* Adds support for asynchronous copy instructions that allow copying of data asynchronously from one
  state space to another.
* Adds support for `mbarrier` instructions that allow creation of *mbarrier objects* in memory and
  use of these objects to synchronize threads and asynchronous copy operations initiated by threads.
* Adds support for `redux.sync` instruction which allows reduction operation across threads in a
  warp.
* Adds support for new alternate floating-point data formats `.bf16` and `.tf32`.
* Extends `wmma` instruction to support `.f64` type with shape `.m8n8k4`.
* Extends `wmma` instruction to support `.bf16` data format.
* Extends `wmma` instruction to support `.tf32` data format with shape `.m16n16k8`.
* Extends `mma` instruction to support `.f64` type with shape `.m8n8k4`.
* Extends `mma` instruction to support `.bf16` and `.tf32` data formats with shape
  `.m16n8k8`.
* Extends `mma` instruction to support new shapes `.m8n8k128`, `.m16n8k4`, `.m16n8k16`,
  `.m16n8k32`, `.m16n8k64`, `.m16n8k128` and `.m16n8k256`.
* Extends `abs` and `neg` instructions to support `.bf16` and `.bf16x2` data formats.
* Extends `min` and `max` instructions to support `.NaN` modifier and `.f16`, `.f16x2`,
  `.bf16` and `.bf16x2` data formats.
* Extends `fma` instruction to support `.relu` saturation mode and `.bf16` and `.bf16x2`
  data formats.
* Extends `cvt` instruction to support `.relu` saturation mode and `.f16`, `.f16x2`,
  `.bf16`, `.bf16x2` and `.tf32` destination formats.
* Adds support for `tanh` instruction that computes hyperbolic-tangent.
* Extends `ex2` instruction to support `.f16` and `.f16x2` types.
