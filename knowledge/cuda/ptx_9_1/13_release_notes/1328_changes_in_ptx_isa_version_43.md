* A new `lop3` instruction which allows arbitrary logical operation on 3 inputs.
* Adds support for 64-bit computations in extended precision arithmetic instructions.
* Extends `tex.grad` instruction to support `cube` and `acube` geometries.
* Extends `tld4` instruction to support `a2d`, `cube` and `acube` geometries.
