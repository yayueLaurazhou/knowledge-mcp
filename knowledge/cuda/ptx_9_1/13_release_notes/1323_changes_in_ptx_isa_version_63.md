# 13.23. Changes in PTX ISA Version 6.3

## 13.23. [Changes in PTX ISA Version 6.3](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#changes-in-ptx-isa-version-6-3)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#changes-in-ptx-isa-version-6-3 "Permalink to this headline")

New Features

PTX ISA version 6.3 introduces the following new features:

* Support for `sm_75` target architecture.
* Adds support for a new instruction `nanosleep` that suspends a thread for a specified duration.
* Adds support for `.alias` directive which allows definining alias to function symbol.
* Extends `atom` instruction to perform `.f16` addition operation and `.cas.b16` operation.
* Extends `red` instruction to perform `.f16` addition operation.
* The `wmma` instructions are extended to support multiplicand matrices of type `.s8`, `.u8`,
  `.s4`, `.u4`, `.b1` and accumulator matrices of type `.s32`.

Semantic Changes and Clarifications

* Introduced the mandatory `.aligned` qualifier for all `wmma` instructions.
* Specified the alignment required for the base address and stride parameters passed to
  `wmma.load` and `wmma.store`.
* Clarified that layout of fragment returned by `wmma` operation is architecture dependent and
  passing `wmma` fragments around functions compiled for different link compatible SM
  architectures may not work as expected.
* Clarified that atomicity for `{atom/red}.f16x2}` operations is guranteed separately for each of
  the two `.f16` elements but not guranteed to be atomic as single 32-bit access.
