New Features

The underlying, stack-based ABI is supported in PTX ISA version 2.1 for `sm_2x` targets.

Support for indirect calls has been implemented for `sm_2x` targets.

New directives, `.branchtargets` and `.calltargets`, have been added for specifying potential
targets for indirect branches and indirect function calls. A `.callprototype` directive has been
added for declaring the type signatures for indirect function calls.

The names of `.global` and `.const` variables can now be specified in variable initializers to
represent their addresses.

A set of thirty-two driver-specific execution environment special registers has been added. These
are named `%envreg0..%envreg31`.

Textures and surfaces have new fields for channel data type and channel order, and the `txq` and
`suq` instructions support queries for these fields.

Directive `.minnctapersm` has replaced the `.maxnctapersm` directive.

Directive `.reqntid` has been added to allow specification of exact CTA dimensions.

A new instruction, `rcp.approx.ftz.f64`, has been added to compute a fast, gross approximate
reciprocal.

Semantic Changes and Clarifications

A warning is emitted if `.minnctapersm` is specified without also specifying `.maxntid`.
