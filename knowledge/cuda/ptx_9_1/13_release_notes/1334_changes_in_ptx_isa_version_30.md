# 13.34. Changes in PTX ISA Version 3.0

## 13.34. [Changes in PTX ISA Version 3.0](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#changes-in-ptx-isa-version-3-0)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#changes-in-ptx-isa-version-3-0 "Permalink to this headline")

New Features

PTX ISA version 3.0 introduces the following new features:

* Support for `sm_30` target architectures.
* SIMD video instructions.
* A new warp shuffle instruction.
* Instructions `mad.cc` and `madc` for efficient, extended-precision integer multiplication.
* Surface instructions with 3D and array geometries.
* The texture instruction supports reads from cubemap and cubemap array textures.
* Platform option `.target` debug to declare that a PTX module contains `DWARF` debug information.
* `pmevent.mask`, for triggering multiple performance monitor events.
* Performance monitor counter special registers `%pm4..%pm7`.

Semantic Changes and Clarifications

Special register `%gridid` has been extended from 32-bits to 64-bits.

PTX ISA version 3.0 deprecates module-scoped `.reg` and `.local` variables when compiling to the
Application Binary Interface (ABI). When compiling without use of the ABI, module-scoped `.reg`
and `.local` variables are supported as before. When compiling legacy PTX code (ISA versions prior
to 3.0) containing module-scoped `.reg` or `.local` variables, the compiler silently disables
use of the ABI.

The `shfl` instruction semantics were updated to clearly indicate that value of source operand
`a` is unpredictable for inactive and predicated-off threads within the warp.

PTX modules no longer allow duplicate `.version` directives. This feature was unimplemented, so
there is no semantic change.

Unimplemented instructions `suld.p` and `sust.p.{u32,s32,f32}` have been removed.
