# 13.24. Changes in PTX ISA Version 6.2

## 13.24. [Changes in PTX ISA Version 6.2](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#changes-in-ptx-isa-version-6-2)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#changes-in-ptx-isa-version-6-2 "Permalink to this headline")

New Features

PTX ISA version 6.2 introduces the following new features:

* A new instruction `activemask` for querying active threads in a warp.
* Extends atomic and reduction instructions to perform `.f16x2` addition operation with mandatory
  `.noftz` qualifier.

Deprecated Features

PTX ISA version 6.2 deprecates the following features:

* The use of `shfl` and `vote` instructions without the `.sync` is deprecated retrospectively
  from PTX ISA version 6.0, which introduced the `sm_70` architecture that implements
  [Independent Thread Scheduling](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#independent-thread-scheduling).

Semantic Changes and Clarifications

* Clarified that `wmma` instructions can be used in conditionally executed code only if it is
  known that all threads in the warp evaluate the condition identically, otherwise behavior is
  undefined.
* In the memory consistency model, the definition of *morally strong operations* was updated to
  exclude fences from the requirement of *complete overlap* since fences do not access memory.
