## 13.27. [Changes in PTX ISA Version 5.0](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#changes-in-ptx-isa-version-5-0)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#changes-in-ptx-isa-version-5-0 "Permalink to this headline")

New Features

PTX ISA version 5.0 introduces the following new features:

* Support for `sm_60`, `sm_61`, `sm_62` target architecture.
* Extends atomic and reduction instructions to perform double-precision add operation.
* Extends atomic and reduction instructions to specify `scope` modifier.
* A new `.common` directive to permit linking multiple object files containing declarations of the
  same symbol with different size.
* A new `dp4a` instruction which allows 4-way dot product with accumulate operation.
* A new `dp2a` instruction which allows 2-way dot product with accumulate operation.
* Support for special register `%clock_hi`.

Semantic Changes and Clarifications

Semantics of cache modifiers on `ld` and `st` instructions were clarified to reflect cache
operations are treated as performance hint only and do not change memory consistency behavior of the
program.

Semantics of `volatile` operations on `ld` and `st` instructions were clarified to reflect how
`volatile` operations are handled by optimizing compiler.
