## 13.17. [Changes in PTX ISA Version 7.3](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#changes-in-ptx-isa-version-7-3)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#changes-in-ptx-isa-version-7-3 "Permalink to this headline")

New Features

PTX ISA version 7.3 introduces the following new features:

* Extends `mask()` operator used in initializers to also support integer constant expression.
* Adds support for stack manpulation instructions that allow manipulating stack using `stacksave`
  and `stackrestore` instructions and allocation of per-thread stack using `alloca`
  instruction.

Semantic Changes and Clarifications

The unimplemented version of `alloca` from the older PTX ISA specification has been replaced with
new stack manipulation instructions in PTX ISA version 7.3.
