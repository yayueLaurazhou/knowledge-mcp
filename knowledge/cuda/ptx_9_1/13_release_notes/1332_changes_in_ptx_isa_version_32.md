# 13.32. Changes in PTX ISA Version 3.2

## 13.32. [Changes in PTX ISA Version 3.2](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#changes-in-ptx-isa-version-3-2)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#changes-in-ptx-isa-version-3-2 "Permalink to this headline")

New Features

PTX ISA version 3.2 introduces the following new features:

* The texture instruction supports reads from multi-sample and multisample array textures.
* Extends `.section` debugging directive to include label + immediate expressions.
* Extends `.file` directive to include timestamp and file size information.

Semantic Changes and Clarifications

The `vavrg2` and `vavrg4` instruction semantics were updated to indicate that instruction adds 1
only if Va[i] + Vb[i] is non-negative, and that the addition result is shifted by 1 (rather than
being divided by 2).
