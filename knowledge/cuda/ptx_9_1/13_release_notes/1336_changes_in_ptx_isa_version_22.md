New Features

PTX 2.2 adds a new directive for specifying kernel parameter attributes; specifically, there is a
new directives for specifying that a kernel parameter is a pointer, for specifying to which state
space the parameter points, and for optionally specifying the alignment of the memory to which the
parameter points.

PTX 2.2 adds a new field named `force_unnormalized_coords` to the `.samplerref` opaque
type. This field is used in the independent texturing mode to override the `normalized_coords`
field in the texture header. This field is needed to support languages such as OpenCL, which
represent the property of normalized/unnormalized coordinates in the sampler header rather than in
the texture header.

PTX 2.2 deprecates explicit constant banks and supports a large, flat address space for the
`.const` state space. Legacy PTX that uses explicit constant banks is still supported.

PTX 2.2 adds a new `tld4` instruction for loading a component (`r`, `g`, `b`, or `a`) from
the four texels compising the bilinear interpolation footprint of a given texture location. This
instruction may be used to compute higher-precision bilerp results in software, or for performing
higher-bandwidth texture loads.
