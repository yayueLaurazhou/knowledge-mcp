# 13.35. Changes in PTX ISA Version 2.3

## 13.35. [Changes in PTX ISA Version 2.3](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#changes-in-ptx-isa-version-2-3)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#changes-in-ptx-isa-version-2-3 "Permalink to this headline")

New Features

PTX 2.3 adds support for texture arrays. The texture array feature supports access to an array of 1D
or 2D textures, where an integer indexes into the array of textures, and then one or two
single-precision floating point coordinates are used to address within the selected 1D or 2D
texture.

PTX 2.3 adds a new directive, `.address_size`, for specifying the size of addresses.

Variables in `.const` and `.global` state spaces are initialized to zero by default.

Semantic Changes and Clarifications

The semantics of the `.maxntid` directive have been updated to match the current
implementation. Specifically, `.maxntid` only guarantees that the total number of threads in a
thread block does not exceed the maximum. Previously, the semantics indicated that the maximum was
enforced separately in each dimension, which is not the case.

Bit field extract and insert instructions BFE and BFI now indicate that the `len` and `pos`
operands are restricted to the value range `0..255`.

Unimplemented instructions `{atom,red}.{min,max}.f32` have been removed.
