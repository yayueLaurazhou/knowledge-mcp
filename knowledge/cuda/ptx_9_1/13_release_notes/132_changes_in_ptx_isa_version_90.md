# 13.2. Changes in PTX ISA Version 9.0

## 13.2. [Changes in PTX ISA Version 9.0](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#changes-in-ptx-isa-version-9-0)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#changes-in-ptx-isa-version-9-0 "Permalink to this headline")

New Features

PTX ISA version 9.0 introduces the following new features:

* Adds support for `sm_88` target architecture.
* Adds support for `sm_110` target architecture.
* Adds support for target `sm_110f` that supports family-specific features.
* Adds support for target `sm_110a` that supports architecture-specific features.
* Adds support for pragma `enable_smem_spilling` that is used to enable shared
  memory spilling for a function.
* Adds support for pragma `frequency` that is used to specify the execution frequency of a basic
  block.
* Adds support for directive `.blocksareclusters` that is used to specify that CUDA thread blocks
  are mapped to clusters.
* Extends `size` operand of `st.bulk` instruction to support 32-bit length.
* Adds support for performance-tuning directives `.abi_preserve` and `.abi_preserve_control`
  that are used to specify the number of data and control registers that should be preserved by the
  callers of a function.

Notes

* Targets `sm_{101,101f,101a}` are renamed to targets `sm_{110,110f,110a}` from PTX ISA version 9.0.

Semantic Changes and Clarifications

* All `tcgen05` instructions(`tcgen05.alloc`, `tcgen05.dealloc`, `tcgen05.relinquish_alloc_permit`,
  `tcgen05.cp`, `tcgen05.shift`, `tcgen05.mma`, `tcgen05.mma.sp`, `tcgen05.mma.ws, tcgen05.mma.ws.sp`,
  `tcgen05.commit`) within a kernel must specify the same value for the `.cta_group` qualifier.
