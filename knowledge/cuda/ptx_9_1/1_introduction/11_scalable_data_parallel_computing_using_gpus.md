Driven by the insatiable market demand for real-time, high-definition 3D graphics, the programmable
GPU has evolved into a highly parallel, multithreaded, many-core processor with tremendous
computational horsepower and very high memory bandwidth. The GPU is especially well-suited to
address problems that can be expressed as data-parallel computations - the same program is executed
on many data elements in parallel - with high arithmetic intensity - the ratio of arithmetic
operations to memory operations. Because the same program is executed for each data element, there
is a lower requirement for sophisticated flow control; and because it is executed on many data
elements and has high arithmetic intensity, the memory access latency can be hidden with
calculations instead of big data caches.

Data-parallel processing maps data elements to parallel processing threads. Many applications that
process large data sets can use a data-parallel programming model to speed up the computations. In
3D rendering large sets of pixels and vertices are mapped to parallel threads. Similarly, image and
media processing applications such as post-processing of rendered images, video encoding and
decoding, image scaling, stereo vision, and pattern recognition can map image blocks and pixels to
parallel processing threads. In fact, many algorithms outside the field of image rendering and
processing are accelerated by data-parallel processing, from general signal processing or physics
simulation to computational finance or computational biology.

*PTX* defines a virtual machine and ISA for general purpose parallel thread execution. PTX programs
are translated at install time to the target hardware instruction set. The PTX-to-GPU translator
and driver enable NVIDIA GPUs to be used as programmable parallel computers.
