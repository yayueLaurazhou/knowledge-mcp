# 4.1. Source Format

## 4.1. [Source Format](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#source-format)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#source-format "Permalink to this headline")

Source modules are ASCII text. Lines are separated by the newline character (`\n`).

All whitespace characters are equivalent; whitespace is ignored except for its use in separating
tokens in the language.

The C preprocessor cpp may be used to process PTX source modules. Lines beginning with `#` are
preprocessor directives. The following are common preprocessor directives:

`#include`, `#define`, `#if`, `#ifdef`, `#else`, `#endif`, `#line`, `#file`

*C: A Reference Manual* by Harbison and Steele provides a good description of the C preprocessor.

PTX is case sensitive and uses lowercase for keywords.

Each PTX module must begin with a `.version` directive specifying the PTX language version,
followed by a `.target` directive specifying the target architecture assumed. See
[PTX Module Directives](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#ptx-module-directives) for a more information on these directives.
