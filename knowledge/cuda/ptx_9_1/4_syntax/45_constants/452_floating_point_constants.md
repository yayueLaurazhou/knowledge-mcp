# 4.5.2. Floating-Point Constants

### 4.5.2. [Floating-Point Constants](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#floating-point-constants)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#floating-point-constants "Permalink to this headline")

Floating-point constants are represented as 64-bit double-precision values, and all floating-point
constant expressions are evaluated using 64-bit double precision arithmetic. The only exception is
the 32-bit hex notation for expressing an exact single-precision floating-point value; such values
retain their exact 32-bit single-precision value and may not be used in constant expressions. Each
64-bit floating-point constant is converted to the appropriate floating-point size based on the data
or instruction type at its use.

Floating-point literals may be written with an optional decimal point and an optional signed
exponent. Unlike C and C++, there is no suffix letter to specify size; literals are always
represented in 64-bit double-precision format.

PTX includes a second representation of floating-point constants for specifying the exact machine
representation using a hexadecimal constant. To specify IEEE 754 double-precision floating point
values, the constant begins with `0d` or `0D` followed by 16 hex digits. To specify IEEE 754
single-precision floating point values, the constant begins with `0f` or `0F` followed by 8 hex
digits.

```
0[fF]{hexdigit}{8}      // single-precision floating point
0[dD]{hexdigit}{16}     // double-precision floating point
```
