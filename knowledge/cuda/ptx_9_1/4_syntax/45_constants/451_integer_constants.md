# 4.5.1. Integer Constants

### 4.5.1. [Integer Constants](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#integer-constants)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#integer-constants "Permalink to this headline")

Integer constants are 64-bits in size and are either signed or unsigned, i.e., every integer
constant has type `.s64` or `.u64`. The signed/unsigned nature of an integer constant is needed
to correctly evaluate constant expressions containing operations such as division and ordered
comparisons, where the behavior of the operation depends on the operand types. When used in an
instruction or data initialization, each integer constant is converted to the appropriate size based
on the data or instruction type at its use.

Integer literals may be written in decimal, hexadecimal, octal, or binary notation. The syntax
follows that of C. Integer literals may be followed immediately by the letter `U` to indicate that
the literal is unsigned.

```
hexadecimal literal:  0[xX]{hexdigit}+U?
octal literal:        0{octal digit}+U?
binary literal:       0[bB]{bit}+U?
decimal literal       {nonzero-digit}{digit}*U?
```

Integer literals are non-negative and have a type determined by their magnitude and optional type
suffix as follows: literals are signed (`.s64`) unless the value cannot be fully represented in
`.s64` or the unsigned suffix is specified, in which case the literal is unsigned (`.u64`).

The predefined integer constant `WARP_SZ` specifies the number of threads per warp for the target
platform; to date, all target architectures have a `WARP_SZ` value of 32.
