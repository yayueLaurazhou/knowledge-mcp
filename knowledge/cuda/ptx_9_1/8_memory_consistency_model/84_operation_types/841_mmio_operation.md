# 8.4.1. mmio Operation

### 8.4.1. [mmio Operation](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#mmio-operation)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#mmio-operation "Permalink to this headline")

An *mmio* operation is a memory operation with `.mmio` qualifier specified. It is usually performed
on a memory location which is mapped to the control registers of peer I/O devices. It can also be
used for communication between threads but has poor performance relative to non-*mmio* operations.

The semantic meaning of *mmio* operations cannot be defined precisely as it is defined by the
underlying I/O device. For formal specification of semantics of *mmio* operation from Memory
Consistency Model perspective, it is equivalent to the semantics of a *strong* operation. But it
follows a few implementation-specific properties, if it meets the *CUDA atomicity requirements* at
the specified scope:

* Writes are always performed and are never combined within the scope specified.
* Reads are always performed, and are not forwarded, prefetched, combined, or allowed to hit any
  cache within the scope specified.

  + As an exception, in some implementations, the surrounding locations may also be loaded. In such
    cases the amount of data loaded is implementation specific and varies between 32 and 128 bytes
    in size.
