# 8.2.1. Overlap

### 8.2.1. [Overlap](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#overlap)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#overlap "Permalink to this headline")

Two memory locations are said to overlap when the starting address of one location is within the
range of bytes constituting the other location. Two memory operations are said to overlap when they
specify the same virtual address and the corresponding memory locations overlap. The overlap is said
to be complete when both memory locations are identical, and it is said to be partial otherwise.
