# 8.2.6. Initialization

### 8.2.6. [Initialization](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#initialization)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#initialization "Permalink to this headline")

Each byte in memory is initialized by a hypothetical write *W0* executed before starting any thread
in the program. If the byte is included in a program variable, and that variable has an initial
value, then *W0* writes the corresponding initial value for that byte; else *W0* is assumed to have
written an unknown but constant value to the byte.
