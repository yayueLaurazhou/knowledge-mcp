# 8.2.5. Memory Operations on Packed Data Types

### 8.2.5. [Memory Operations on Packed Data Types](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#memory-operations-on-packed-data-types)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#memory-operations-on-packed-data-types "Permalink to this headline")

A packed data type consists of two values of the same scalar data type, as described in
[Packed Data Types](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#packed-data-types). These values are accessed in adjacent memory locations. A
memory operation on a packed data type is modelled as a pair of equivalent memory operations on the
scalar data type, executed in an unspecified order on each element of the packed data.
