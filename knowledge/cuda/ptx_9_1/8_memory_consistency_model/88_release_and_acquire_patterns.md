# 8.8. Release and Acquire Patterns

## 8.8. [Release and Acquire Patterns](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#release-acquire-patterns)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#release-acquire-patterns "Permalink to this headline")

Some sequences of instructions give rise to patterns that participate in memory synchronization as
described later. The *release* pattern makes prior operations from the current thread1
visible to some operations from other threads. The *acquire* pattern makes some operations from
other threads visible to later operations from the current thread.

A *release* pattern on a location M consists of one of the following:

1. A *release* operation on M

   E.g.: `st.release [M];` or `atom.release [M];` or `mbarrier.arrive.release [M];`
2. Or a *release* or *acquire-release* operation on M followed by a *strong* write on M in *program order*

   E.g.: `st.release [M]`; `st.relaxed [M];`
3. Or a *release* or *acquire-release* *memory fence* followed by a *strong*
   write on M in *program order*

   E.g.: `fence.release; st.relaxed [M];` or `fence.release; atom.relaxed [M];`

Any *memory synchronization* established by a *release* pattern only affects operations occurring in
*program order* before the first instruction in that pattern.

An *acquire* pattern on a location M consists of one of the following:

1. An *acquire* operation on M

   E.g.: `ld.acquire [M];` or `atom.acquire [M];` or `mbarrier.test_wait.acquire [M];`
2. Or a *strong* read on M followed by an *acquire* operation on M in *program order*

   E.g.: `ld.relaxed [M]; ld.acquire [M];`
3. Or a *strong* read on M followed by an acquire *memory fence* in *program order*

   E.g.: `ld.relaxed [M]; fence.acquire;` or `atom.relaxed [M]; fence.acquire;`

Any *memory synchronization* established by an *acquire* pattern only affects operations occurring
in *program order* after the last instruction in that pattern.

Note that while atomic reductions conceptually perform a strong read as part of its
read-modify-write sequence, this strong read does not form an acquire pattern.

> E.g.: `red.add [M], 1; fence.acquire;` is not an acquire pattern.

1 For both *release* and *acquire* patterns, this effect is further extended to operations in
other threads through the transitive nature of *causality order*.
