# 8. [Memory Consistency Model](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#memory-consistency-model)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#memory-consistency-model "Permalink to this headline")

In multi-threaded executions, the side-effects of memory operations performed by each thread become
visible to other threads in a partial and non-identical order. This means that any two operations
may appear to happen in no order, or in different orders, to different threads. The axioms
introduced by the memory consistency model specify exactly which contradictions are forbidden
between the orders observed by different threads.

In the absence of any constraint, each read operation returns the value committed by some write
operation to the same memory location, including the initial write to that memory location. The
memory consistency model effectively constrains the set of such candidate writes from which a read
operation can return a value.
