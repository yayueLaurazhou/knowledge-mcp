# 11.4.1.1. Thread Block Group

#### 11.4.1.1. Thread Block Group[](#thread-block-group "Permalink to this headline")

Any CUDA programmer is already familiar with a certain group of threads: the thread block. The Cooperative Groups extension introduces a new datatype, `thread_block`, to explicitly represent this concept within the kernel.

`class thread_block;`

Constructed via:

```
thread_block g = this_thread_block();
```

**Public Member Functions:**

`static void sync()`: Synchronize the threads named in the group, equivalent to `g.barrier_wait(g.barrier_arrive())`

`thread_block::arrival_token barrier_arrive()`: Arrive on the thread\_block barrier, returns a token that needs to be passed into `barrier_wait()`. More details [here](#collectives-cg-sync)

`void barrier_wait(thread_block::arrival_token&& t)`: Wait on the `thread_block` barrier, takes arrival token returned from `barrier_arrive()` as an rvalue reference. More details [here](#collectives-cg-sync)

`static unsigned int thread_rank()`: Rank of the calling thread within [0, num\_threads)

`static dim3 group_index()`: 3-Dimensional index of the block within the launched grid

`static dim3 thread_index()`: 3-Dimensional index of the thread within the launched block

`static dim3 dim_threads()`: Dimensions of the launched block in units of threads

`static unsigned int num_threads()`: Total number of threads in the group

Legacy member functions (aliases):

`static unsigned int size()`: Total number of threads in the group (alias of `num_threads()`)

`static dim3 group_dim()`: Dimensions of the launched block (alias of `dim_threads()`)

**Example:**

```
/// Loading an integer from global into shared memory
__global__ void kernel(int *globalInput) {
    __shared__ int x;
    thread_block g = this_thread_block();
    // Choose a leader in the thread block
    if (g.thread_rank() == 0) {
        // load from global into shared for all threads to work with
        x = (*globalInput);
    }
    // After loading data into shared memory, you want to synchronize
    // if all threads in your thread block need to see it
    g.sync(); // equivalent to __syncthreads();
}
```

**Note:** that all threads in the group must participate in collective operations, or the behavior is undefined.

**Related:** The `thread_block` datatype is derived from the more generic `thread_group` datatype, which can be used to represent a wider class of groups.
