# 11.4.1.3. Grid Group

#### 11.4.1.3. Grid Group[](#grid-group "Permalink to this headline")

This group object represents all the threads launched in a single grid. APIs other than `sync()` are available at all times, but to be able to synchronize across the grid, you need to use the cooperative launch API.

`class grid_group;`

Constructed via:

```
grid_group g = this_grid();
```

**Public Member Functions:**

`bool is_valid() const`: Returns whether the grid\_group can synchronize

`void sync() const`: Synchronize the threads named in the group, equivalent to `g.barrier_wait(g.barrier_arrive())`

`grid_group::arrival_token barrier_arrive()`: Arrive on the grid barrier, returns a token that needs to be passed into `barrier_wait()`. More details [here](#collectives-cg-sync)

`void barrier_wait(grid_group::arrival_token&& t)`: Wait on the grid barrier, takes arrival token returned from `barrier_arrive()` as a rvalue reference. More details [here](#collectives-cg-sync)

`static unsigned long long thread_rank()`: Rank of the calling thread within [0, num\_threads)

`static unsigned long long block_rank()`: Rank of the calling block within [0, num\_blocks)

`static unsigned long long cluster_rank()`: Rank of the calling cluster within [0, num\_clusters)

`static unsigned long long num_threads()`: Total number of threads in the group

`static unsigned long long num_blocks()`: Total number of blocks in the group

`static unsigned long long num_clusters()`: Total number of clusters in the group

`static dim3 dim_blocks()`: Dimensions of the launched grid in units of blocks

`static dim3 dim_clusters()`: Dimensions of the launched grid in units of clusters

`static dim3 block_index()`: 3-Dimensional index of the block within the launched grid

`static dim3 cluster_index()`: 3-Dimensional index of the cluster within the launched grid

Legacy member functions (aliases):

`static unsigned long long size()`: Total number of threads in the group (alias of `num_threads()`)

`static dim3 group_dim()`: Dimensions of the launched grid (alias of `dim_blocks()`)
