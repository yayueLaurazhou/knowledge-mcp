# 11.6.3.2. Reduce Operators

#### 11.6.3.2. `Reduce` Operators[](#reduce-operators "Permalink to this headline")

Below are the prototypes of function objects for some of the basic operations that can be done with `reduce`

```
namespace cooperative_groups {
  template <typename Ty>
  struct cg::plus;

  template <typename Ty>
  struct cg::less;

  template <typename Ty>
  struct cg::greater;

  template <typename Ty>
  struct cg::bit_and;

  template <typename Ty>
  struct cg::bit_xor;

  template <typename Ty>
  struct cg::bit_or;
}
```

Reduce is limited to the information available to the implementation at compile time. Thus in order to make use of intrinsics introduced in CC 8.0, the `cg::` namespace exposes several functional objects that mirror the hardware. These objects appear similar to those presented in the C++ STL, with the exception of `less/greater`. The reason for any difference from the STL is that these function objects are designed to actually mirror the operation of the hardware intrinsics.

**Functional description:**

* `cg::plus:` Accepts two values and returns the sum of both using operator+.
* `cg::less:` Accepts two values and returns the lesser using operator<. This differs in that the **lower value is returned** rather than a Boolean.
* `cg::greater:` Accepts two values and returns the greater using operator<. This differs in that the **greater value is returned** rather than a Boolean.
* `cg::bit_and:` Accepts two values and returns the result of operator&.
* `cg::bit_xor:` Accepts two values and returns the result of operator^.
* `cg::bit_or:` Accepts two values and returns the result of operator|.

**Example:**

```
{
    // cg::plus<int> is specialized within cg::reduce and calls __reduce_add_sync(...) on CC 8.0+
    cg::reduce(tile, (int)val, cg::plus<int>());

    // cg::plus<float> fails to match with an accelerator and instead performs a standard shuffle based reduction
    cg::reduce(tile, (float)val, cg::plus<float>());

    // While individual components of a vector are supported, reduce will not use hardware intrinsics for the following
    // It will also be necessary to define a corresponding operator for vector and any custom types that may be used
    int4 vec = {...};
    cg::reduce(tile, vec, cg::plus<int4>())

    // Finally lambdas and other function objects cannot be inspected for dispatch
    // and will instead perform shuffle based reductions using the provided function object.
    cg::reduce(tile, (int)val, [](int l, int r) -> int {return l + r;});
}
```
