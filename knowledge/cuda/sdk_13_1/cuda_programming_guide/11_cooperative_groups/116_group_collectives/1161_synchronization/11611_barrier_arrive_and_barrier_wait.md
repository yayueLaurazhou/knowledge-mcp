#### 11.6.1.1. `barrier_arrive` and `barrier_wait`[](#barrier-arrive-and-barrier-wait "Permalink to this headline")

```
T::arrival_token T::barrier_arrive();
void T::barrier_wait(T::arrival_token&&);
```

`barrier_arrive` and `barrier_wait` member functions provide a synchronization API similar to `cuda::barrier` [(read more)](#aw-barrier). Cooperative Groups automatically initializes the group barrier, but arrive and wait operations have an additional restriction resulting from collective nature of those operations: All threads in the group must arrive and wait at the barrier once per phase.
When `barrier_arrive` is called with a group, result of calling any collective operation or another barrier arrival with that group is undefined until completion of the barrier phase is observed with `barrier_wait` call. Threads blocked on `barrier_wait` might be released from the synchronization before other threads call `barrier_wait`, but only after all threads in the group called `barrier_arrive`.
Group type `T` can be any of the [implicit groups](#group-types-implicit-cg).This allows threads to do independent work after they arrive and before they wait for the synchronization to resolve, allowing to hide some of the synchronization latency.
`barrier_arrive` returns an `arrival_token` object that must be passed into the corresponding `barrier_wait`. Token is consumed this way and can not be used for another `barrier_wait` call.

**Example of barrier\_arrive and barrier\_wait used to synchronize initalization of shared memory across the cluster:**

```
#include <cooperative_groups.h>

using namespace cooperative_groups;

void __device__ init_shared_data(const thread_block& block, int *data);
void __device__ local_processing(const thread_block& block);
void __device__ process_shared_data(const thread_block& block, int *data);

__global__ void cluster_kernel() {
    extern __shared__ int array[];
    auto cluster = this_cluster();
    auto block   = this_thread_block();

    // Use this thread block to initialize some shared state
    init_shared_data(block, &array[0]);

    auto token = cluster.barrier_arrive(); // Let other blocks know this block is running and data was initialized

    // Do some local processing to hide the synchronization latency
    local_processing(block);

    // Map data in shared memory from the next block in the cluster
    int *dsmem = cluster.map_shared_rank(&array[0], (cluster.block_rank() + 1) % cluster.num_blocks());

    // Make sure all other blocks in the cluster are running and initialized shared data before accessing dsmem
    cluster.barrier_wait(std::move(token));

    // Consume data in distributed shared memory
    process_shared_data(block, dsmem);
    cluster.sync();
}
```
