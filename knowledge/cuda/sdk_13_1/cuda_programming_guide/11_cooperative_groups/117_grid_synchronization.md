# 11.7. Grid Synchronization

## 11.7. Grid Synchronization[](#grid-synchronization "Permalink to this headline")

Prior to the introduction of Cooperative Groups, the CUDA programming model only allowed synchronization between thread blocks at a kernel completion boundary. The kernel boundary carries with it an implicit invalidation of state, and with it, potential performance implications.

For example, in certain use cases, applications have a large number of small kernels, with each kernel representing a stage in a processing pipeline. The presence of these kernels is required by the current CUDA programming model to ensure that the thread blocks operating on one pipeline stage have produced data before the thread block operating on the next pipeline stage is ready to consume it. In such cases, the ability to provide global inter thread block synchronization would allow the application to be restructured to have persistent thread blocks, which are able to synchronize on the device when a given stage is complete.

To synchronize across the grid, from within a kernel, you would simply use the `grid.sync()` function:

```
grid_group grid = this_grid();
grid.sync();
```

And when launching the kernel it is necessary to use, instead of the `<<<...>>>` execution configuration syntax, the `cudaLaunchCooperativeKernel` CUDA runtime launch API or the `CUDA driver equivalent`.

**Example:**

To guarantee co-residency of the thread blocks on the GPU, the number of blocks launched needs to be carefully considered. For example, as many blocks as there are SMs can be launched as follows:

```
int dev = 0;
cudaDeviceProp deviceProp;
cudaGetDeviceProperties(&deviceProp, dev);
// initialize, then launch
cudaLaunchCooperativeKernel((void*)my_kernel, deviceProp.multiProcessorCount, numThreads, args);
```

Alternatively, you can maximize the exposed parallelism by calculating how many blocks can fit simultaneously per-SM using the occupancy calculator as follows:

```
/// This will launch a grid that can maximally fill the GPU, on the default stream with kernel arguments
int numBlocksPerSm = 0;
 // Number of threads my_kernel will be launched with
int numThreads = 128;
cudaDeviceProp deviceProp;
cudaGetDeviceProperties(&deviceProp, dev);
cudaOccupancyMaxActiveBlocksPerMultiprocessor(&numBlocksPerSm, my_kernel, numThreads, 0);
// launch
void *kernelArgs[] = { /* add kernel args */ };
dim3 dimBlock(numThreads, 1, 1);
dim3 dimGrid(deviceProp.multiProcessorCount*numBlocksPerSm, 1, 1);
cudaLaunchCooperativeKernel((void*)my_kernel, dimGrid, dimBlock, kernelArgs);
```

It is good practice to first ensure the device supports cooperative launches by querying the device attribute `cudaDevAttrCooperativeLaunch`:

```
int dev = 0;
int supportsCoopLaunch = 0;
cudaDeviceGetAttribute(&supportsCoopLaunch, cudaDevAttrCooperativeLaunch, dev);
```

which will set `supportsCoopLaunch` to 1 if the property is supported on device 0. Only devices with compute capability of 6.0 and higher are supported. In addition, you need to be running on either of these:

* The Linux platform without MPS
* The Linux platform with MPS and on a device with compute capability 7.0 or higher
* The latest Windows platform
