# 10.24.2. Alternate Floating Point

### 10.24.2. Alternate Floating Point[](#alternate-floating-point "Permalink to this headline")

Tensor Cores support alternate types of floating point operations on devices with compute capability 8.0 and higher.

`__nv_bfloat16`
:   This data format is an alternate fp16 format that has the same range as f32 but reduced precision (7 bits). You can use this data format directly with the `__nv_bfloat16` type available in `cuda_bf16.h`. Matrix fragments with `__nv_bfloat16` data types are required to be composed with accumulators of `float` type. The shapes and operations supported are the same as with `__half`.

`tf32`
:   This data format is a special floating point format supported by Tensor Cores, with the same range as f32 and reduced precision (>=10 bits). The internal layout of this format is implementation defined. In order to use this floating point format with WMMA operations, the input matrices must be manually converted to tf32 precision.

    To facilitate conversion, a new intrinsic `__float_to_tf32` is provided. While the input and output arguments to the intrinsic are of `float` type, the output will be `tf32` numerically. This new precision is intended to be used with Tensor Cores only, and if mixed with other `float`type operations, the precision and range of the result will be undefined.

    Once an input matrix (`matrix_a` or `matrix_b`) is converted to tf32 precision, the combination of a `fragment` with `precision::tf32` precision, and a data type of `float` to `load_matrix_sync` will take advantage of this new capability. Both the accumulator fragments must have `float` data types. The only supported matrix size is 16x16x8 (m-n-k).

    The elements of the fragment are represented as `float`, hence the mapping from `element_type<T>` to `storage_element_type<T>` is:

    ```
    precision::tf32 -> float
    ```
