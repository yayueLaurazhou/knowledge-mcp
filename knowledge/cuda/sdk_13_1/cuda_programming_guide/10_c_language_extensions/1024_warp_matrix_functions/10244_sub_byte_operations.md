# 10.24.4. Sub-byte Operations

### 10.24.4. Sub-byte Operations[](#sub-byte-operations "Permalink to this headline")

Sub-byte WMMA operations provide a way to access the low-precision capabilities of Tensor Cores. They are considered a preview feature i.e. the data structures and APIs for them are subject to change and may not be compatible with future releases. This functionality is available via the `nvcuda::wmma::experimental` namespace:

```
namespace experimental {
    namespace precision {
        struct u4; // 4-bit unsigned
        struct s4; // 4-bit signed
        struct b1; // 1-bit
   }
    enum bmmaBitOp {
        bmmaBitOpXOR = 1, // compute_75 minimum
        bmmaBitOpAND = 2  // compute_80 minimum
    };
    enum bmmaAccumulateOp { bmmaAccumulateOpPOPC = 1 };
}
```

For 4 bit precision, the APIs available remain the same, but you must specify `experimental::precision::u4` or `experimental::precision::s4` as the fragment data type. Since the elements of the fragment are packed together, `num_storage_elements` will be smaller than `num_elements` for that fragment. The `num_elements` variable for a sub-byte fragment, hence returns the number of elements of sub-byte type `element_type<T>`. This is true for single bit precision as well, in which case, the mapping from `element_type<T>` to `storage_element_type<T>` is as follows:

```
experimental::precision::u4 -> unsigned (8 elements in 1 storage element)
experimental::precision::s4 -> int (8 elements in 1 storage element)
experimental::precision::b1 -> unsigned (32 elements in 1 storage element)
T -> T  //all other types
```

The allowed layouts for sub-byte fragments is always `row_major` for `matrix_a` and `col_major` for `matrix_b`.

For sub-byte operations the value of `ldm` in `load_matrix_sync` should be a multiple of 32 for element type `experimental::precision::u4` and `experimental::precision::s4` or a multiple of 128 for element type `experimental::precision::b1` (i.e., multiple of 16 bytes in both cases).

Note

Support for the following variants for MMA instructions is deprecated and will be removed in sm\_90:

> * `experimental::precision::u4`
> * `experimental::precision::s4`
> * `experimental::precision::b1` with `bmmaBitOp` set to `bmmaBitOpXOR`

`bmma_sync`
:   Waits until all warp lanes have executed bmma\_sync, and then performs the warp-synchronous bit matrix multiply-accumulate operation `D = (A op B) + C`, where `op` consists of a logical operation `bmmaBitOp` followed by the accumulation defined by `bmmaAccumulateOp`. The available operations are:

    `bmmaBitOpXOR`, a 128-bit XOR of a row in `matrix_a` with the 128-bit column of `matrix_b`

    `bmmaBitOpAND`, a 128-bit AND of a row in `matrix_a` with the 128-bit column of `matrix_b`, available on devices with compute capability 8.0 and higher.

    The accumulate op is always `bmmaAccumulateOpPOPC` which counts the number of set bits.
