# 15.11.1. Creating and Sharing IPC Memory Pools

### 15.11.1. Creating and Sharing IPC Memory Pools[](#creating-and-sharing-ipc-memory-pools "Permalink to this headline")

Sharing access to a pool involves retrieving an OS native handle to the pool (with the `cudaMemPoolExportToShareableHandle()` API), transferring the handle to the importing process using the usual OS native IPC mechanisms, and creating an imported memory pool (with the `cudaMemPoolImportFromShareableHandle()` API). For `cudaMemPoolExportToShareableHandle` to succeed, the memory pool had to be created with the requested handle type specified in the pool properties structure. Please reference samples for the appropriate IPC mechanisms to transfer the OS native handle between processes. The rest of the procedure can be found in the following code snippets.

```
// in exporting process
// create an exportable IPC capable pool on device 0
cudaMemPoolProps poolProps = { };
poolProps.allocType = cudaMemAllocationTypePinned;
poolProps.location.id = 0;
poolProps.location.type = cudaMemLocationTypeDevice;

// Setting handleTypes to a non zero value will make the pool exportable (IPC capable)
poolProps.handleTypes = CU_MEM_HANDLE_TYPE_POSIX_FILE_DESCRIPTOR;

cudaMemPoolCreate(&memPool, &poolProps));

// FD based handles are integer types
int fdHandle = 0;


// Retrieve an OS native handle to the pool.
// Note that a pointer to the handle memory is passed in here.
cudaMemPoolExportToShareableHandle(&fdHandle,
             memPool,
             CU_MEM_HANDLE_TYPE_POSIX_FILE_DESCRIPTOR,
             0);

// The handle must be sent to the importing process with the appropriate
// OS specific APIs.
```

```
// in importing process
 int fdHandle;
// The handle needs to be retrieved from the exporting process with the
// appropriate OS specific APIs.
// Create an imported pool from the shareable handle.
// Note that the handle is passed by value here.
cudaMemPoolImportFromShareableHandle(&importedMemPool,
          (void*)fdHandle,
          CU_MEM_HANDLE_TYPE_POSIX_FILE_DESCRIPTOR,
          0);
```
