NUMA (Non-Uniform Memory Access) is a memory architecture used in
multi-processor computer systems such that the memory is divided into
multiple nodes. Each node has its own processors and memory. In such a
system, NUMA divides the system into nodes and assigns a unique
identifier (numaID) to every node.

EGM uses the NUMA node identifier which is assigned by the operating
system. Note that, this identifier is different from the ordinal of a
device and it is associated with the closest host node. In addition to
the existing methods, the user can obtain the identifier of the host
node (numaID) by calling [cuDeviceGetAttribute](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-driver-api/group__CUDA__DEVICE.html#group__CUDA__DEVICE_1g9c3e1414f0ad901d3278a4d6645fc266)
with `CU_DEVICE_ATTRIBUTE_HOST_NUMA_ID` attribute type as follows:

```
int numaId;
cuDeviceGetAttribute(&numaId, CU_DEVICE_ATTRIBUTE_HOST_NUMA_ID, deviceOrdinal);
```
