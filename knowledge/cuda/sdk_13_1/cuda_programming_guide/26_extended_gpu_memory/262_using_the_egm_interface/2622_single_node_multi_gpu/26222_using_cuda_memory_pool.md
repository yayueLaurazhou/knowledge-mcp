# 26.2.2.2. Using CUDA Memory Pool

#### 26.2.2.2. Using CUDA Memory Pool[](#using-cuda-memory-pool "Permalink to this headline")

To define EGM, the user can create a memory pool on a node and give
access to peers. In this case, the user has to explicitly define
`cudaMemLocationTypeHostNuma` as the location type and numaId
as the location identifier. The following code snippet shows creating a
memory pool `cudaMemPoolCreate`:

```
cudaSetDevice(homeDevice);
cudaMemPoolProps props{};
props.allocType = cudaMemAllocationTypePinned;
props.location.type = cudaMemLocationTypeHostNuma;
props.location.id = numaId;
cudaMemPoolCreate(&memPool, &props);
```

Additionally, for direct connect peer access, it is also possible to use
the existing peer access API, `cudaMemPoolSetAccess`. An example
for an accessingDevice is shown in the following code snippet:

```
cudaMemAccessDesc desc{};
desc.flags = cudaMemAccessFlagsProtReadWrite;
desc.location.type = cudaMemLocationTypeDevice;
desc.location.id = accessingDevice;
cudaMemPoolSetAccess(memPool, &desc, 1);
```

When the memory pool is created, and accesses are given, the user can
set created memory pool to the residentDevice and start allocating
memory using `cudaMallocAsync`:

```
cudaDeviceSetMemPool(residentDevice, memPool);
cudaMallocAsync(&ptr, size, memPool, stream);
```

Note

EGM is mapped with 2MB pages. Therefore, users may encounter more TLB
misses when accessing very large allocations.
