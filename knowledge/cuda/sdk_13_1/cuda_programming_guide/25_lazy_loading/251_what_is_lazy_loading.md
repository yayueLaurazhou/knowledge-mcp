## 25.1. What is Lazy Loading?[](#what-is-lazy-loading "Permalink to this headline")

Lazy Loading delays loading of CUDA modules and kernels from program initialization closer to kernels execution.
If a program does not use every single kernel it has included, then some kernels will be loaded unneccessarily.
This is very common, especially if you include any libraries.
Most of the time, programs only use a small amount of kernels from libraries they include.

Thanks to Lazy Loading, programs are able to only load kernels they are actually going to use, saving time on initialization.
This reduces memory overhead, both on GPU memory and host memory.

Lazy Loading is enabled by setting the `CUDA_MODULE_LOADING` environment variable to `LAZY`.

Firstly, CUDA Runtime will no longer load all modules during program initialization, with the exception of modules containing managed variables.
Each module will be loaded on first usage of a variable or a kernel from that module.
This optimization is only relevant to CUDA Runtime users, CUDA Driver users who use `cuModuleLoad` are unaffected. This optimization shipped in CUDA 11.8.
The behavior for CUDA Driver users who use `cuLibraryLoad` to load module data into memory can be changed by
setting the `CUDA_MODULE_DATA_LOADING` environment variable.

Secondly, loading a module (`cuModuleLoad*()` family of functions) will not be loading kernels immediately,
instead it will delay loading of a kernel until `cuModuleGetFunction()` is called.
There are certain exceptions here, some kernels have to be loaded during `cuModuleLoad*()`,
such as kernels of which pointers are stored in global variables.
This optimization is relevant to both CUDA Runtime and CUDA Driver users.
CUDA Runtime will only call `cuModuleGetFunction()` when a kernel is used/referenced for the first time.
This optimization shipped in CUDA 11.7.

Both of these optimizations are designed to be invisible to the user, assuming CUDA Programming Model is followed.
