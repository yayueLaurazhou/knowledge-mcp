## 16.5. Performance Considerations[](#performance-considerations "Permalink to this headline")

When multiple graphs are launched into the same stream, CUDA attempts to allocate the same physical memory to them because the execution of these graphs cannot overlap. Physical mappings for a graph are retained between launches as an optimization to avoid the cost of remapping. If, at a later time, one of the graphs is launched such that its execution may overlap with the others (for example if it is launched into a different stream) then CUDA must perform some remapping because concurrent graphs require distinct memory to avoid data corruption.

In general, remapping of graph memory in CUDA is likely caused by these operations:

* Changing the stream into which a graph is launched
* A trim operation on the graph memory pool, which explicitly frees unused memory (discussed in [Physical Memory Footprint](#graph-memory-nodes-physical-memory-footprint))
* Relaunching a graph while an unfreed allocation from another graph is mapped to the same memory will cause a remap of memory before relaunch

Remapping must happen in execution order, but after any previous execution of that graph is complete (otherwise memory that is still in use could be unmapped). Due to this ordering dependency, as well as because mapping operations are OS calls, mapping operations can be relatively expensive. Applications can avoid this cost by launching graphs containing allocation memory nodes consistently into the same stream.
