# 16.7.2. Peer Access with Stream Capture

### 16.7.2. Peer Access with Stream Capture[](#peer-access-with-stream-capture "Permalink to this headline")

For stream capture, the allocation node records the peer accessibility of the allocating pool at the time of the capture. Altering the peer accessibility of the allocating pool after a `cudaMallocFromPoolAsync` call is captured does not affect the mappings that the graph will make for the allocation.

```
// boilerplate for the access descs (only ReadWrite and Device access supported by the add node api)
accessDesc.flags = cudaMemAccessFlagsProtReadWrite;
accessDesc.location.type = cudaMemLocationTypeDevice;
accessDesc.location.id = 1;

// let memPool be resident and accessible on device 0

cudaStreamBeginCapture(stream);
cudaMallocAsync(&dptr1, size, memPool, stream);
cudaStreamEndCapture(stream, &graph1);

cudaMemPoolSetAccess(memPool, &accessDesc, 1);

cudaStreamBeginCapture(stream);
cudaMallocAsync(&dptr2, size, memPool, stream);
cudaStreamEndCapture(stream, &graph2);

//The graph node allocating dptr1 would only have the device 0 accessibility even though memPool now has device 1 accessibility.
//The graph node allocating dptr2 will have device 0 and device 1 accessibility, since that was the pool accessibility at the time of the cudaMallocAsync call.
```
