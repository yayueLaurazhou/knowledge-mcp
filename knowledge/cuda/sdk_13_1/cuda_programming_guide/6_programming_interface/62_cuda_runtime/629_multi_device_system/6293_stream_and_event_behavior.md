# 6.2.9.3. Stream and Event Behavior

#### 6.2.9.3. Stream and Event Behavior[](#stream-and-event-behavior "Permalink to this headline")

A kernel launch will fail if it is issued to a stream that is not associated to the current device as illustrated in the following code sample.

```
cudaSetDevice(0);               // Set device 0 as current
cudaStream_t s0;
cudaStreamCreate(&s0);          // Create stream s0 on device 0
MyKernel<<<100, 64, 0, s0>>>(); // Launch kernel on device 0 in s0
cudaSetDevice(1);               // Set device 1 as current
cudaStream_t s1;
cudaStreamCreate(&s1);          // Create stream s1 on device 1
MyKernel<<<100, 64, 0, s1>>>(); // Launch kernel on device 1 in s1

// This kernel launch will fail:
MyKernel<<<100, 64, 0, s0>>>(); // Launch kernel on device 1 in s0
```

A memory copy will succeed even if it is issued to a stream that is not associated to the current device.

`cudaEventRecord()` will fail if the input event and input stream are associated to different devices.

`cudaEventElapsedTime()` will fail if the two input events are associated to different devices.

`cudaEventSynchronize()` and `cudaEventQuery()` will succeed even if the input event is associated to a device that is different from the current device.

`cudaStreamWaitEvent()` will succeed even if the input stream and input event are associated to different devices. `cudaStreamWaitEvent()` can therefore be used to synchronize multiple devices with each other.

Each device has its own default stream (see [Default Stream](#default-stream)), so commands issued to the default stream of a device may execute out of order or concurrently with respect to commands issued to the default stream of any other device.
