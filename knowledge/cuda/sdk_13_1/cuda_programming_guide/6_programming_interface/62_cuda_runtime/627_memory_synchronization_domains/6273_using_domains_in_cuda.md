# 6.2.7.3. Using Domains in CUDA

#### 6.2.7.3. Using Domains in CUDA[](#using-domains-in-cuda "Permalink to this headline")

Domains are accessible via the new launch attributes `cudaLaunchAttributeMemSyncDomain` and `cudaLaunchAttributeMemSyncDomainMap`. The former selects between logical domains `cudaLaunchMemSyncDomainDefault` and `cudaLaunchMemSyncDomainRemote`, and the latter provides a mapping from logical to physical domains. The remote domain is intended for kernels performing remote memory access in order to isolate their memory traffic from local kernels. Note, however, the selection of a particular domain does not affect what memory access a kernel may legally perform.

The domain count can be queried via device attribute `cudaDevAttrMemSyncDomainCount`. Hopper has 4 domains. To facilitate portable code, domains functionality can be used on all devices and CUDA will report a count of 1 prior to Hopper.

Having logical domains eases application composition. An individual kernel launch at a low level in the stack, such as from NCCL, can select a semantic logical domain without concern for the surrounding application architecture. Higher levels can steer logical domains using the mapping. The default value for the logical domain if it is not set is the default domain, and the default mapping is to map the default domain to 0 and the remote domain to 1 (on GPUs with more than 1 domain). Specific libraries may tag launches with the remote domain in CUDA 12.0 and later; for example, NCCL 2.16 will do so. Together, this provides a beneficial use pattern for common applications out of the box, with no code changes needed in other components, frameworks, or at application level. An alternative use pattern, for example in an application using nvshmem or with no clear separation of kernel types, could be to partition parallel streams. Stream A may map both logical domains to physical domain 0, stream B to 1, and so on.

```
// Example of launching a kernel with the remote logical domain
cudaLaunchAttribute domainAttr;
domainAttr.id = cudaLaunchAttrMemSyncDomain;
domainAttr.val = cudaLaunchMemSyncDomainRemote;
cudaLaunchConfig_t config;
// Fill out other config fields
config.attrs = &domainAttr;
config.numAttrs = 1;
cudaLaunchKernelEx(&config, myKernel, kernelArg1, kernelArg2...);
```

```
// Example of setting a mapping for a stream
// (This mapping is the default for streams starting on Hopper if not
// explicitly set, and provided for illustration)
cudaLaunchAttributeValue mapAttr;
mapAttr.memSyncDomainMap.default_ = 0;
mapAttr.memSyncDomainMap.remote = 1;
cudaStreamSetAttribute(stream, cudaLaunchAttributeMemSyncDomainMap, &mapAttr);
```

```
// Example of mapping different streams to different physical domains, ignoring
// logical domain settings
cudaLaunchAttributeValue mapAttr;
mapAttr.memSyncDomainMap.default_ = 0;
mapAttr.memSyncDomainMap.remote = 0;
cudaStreamSetAttribute(streamA, cudaLaunchAttributeMemSyncDomainMap, &mapAttr);
mapAttr.memSyncDomainMap.default_ = 1;
mapAttr.memSyncDomainMap.remote = 1;
cudaStreamSetAttribute(streamB, cudaLaunchAttributeMemSyncDomainMap, &mapAttr);
```

As with other launch attributes, these are exposed uniformly on CUDA streams, individual launches using `cudaLaunchKernelEx`, and kernel nodes in CUDA graphs. A typical use would set the mapping at stream level and the logical domain at launch level (or bracketing a section of stream use) as described above.

Both attributes are copied to graph nodes during stream capture. Graphs take both attributes from the node itself, essentially an indirect way of specifying a physical domain. Domain-related attributes set on the stream a graph is launched into are not used in execution of the graph.
