# 6.2.3.3. L2 Access Properties

#### 6.2.3.3. L2 Access Properties[](#l2-access-properties "Permalink to this headline")

Three types of access properties are defined for different global memory data accesses:

1. `cudaAccessPropertyStreaming`: Memory accesses that occur with the streaming property are less likely to persist in the L2 cache because these accesses are preferentially evicted.
2. `cudaAccessPropertyPersisting`: Memory accesses that occur with the persisting property are more likely to persist in the L2 cache because these accesses are preferentially retained in the set-aside portion of L2 cache.
3. `cudaAccessPropertyNormal`: This access property forcibly resets previously applied persisting access property to a normal status. Memory accesses with the persisting property from previous CUDA kernels may be retained in L2 cache long after their intended use. This persistence-after-use reduces the amount of L2 cache available to subsequent kernels that do not use the persisting property. Resetting an access property window with the `cudaAccessPropertyNormal` property removes the persisting (preferential retention) status of the prior access, as if the prior access had been without an access property.
