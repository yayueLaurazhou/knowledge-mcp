# 6.2.3.5. Reset L2 Access to Normal

#### 6.2.3.5. Reset L2 Access to Normal[](#reset-l2-access-to-normal "Permalink to this headline")

A persisting L2 cache line from a previous CUDA kernel may persist in L2 long after it has been used. Hence, a reset to normal for L2 cache is important for streaming or normal memory accesses to utilize the L2 cache with normal priority. There are three ways a persisting access can be reset to normal status.

1. Reset a previous persisting memory region with the access property, `cudaAccessPropertyNormal`.
2. Reset all persisting L2 cache lines to normal by calling `cudaCtxResetPersistingL2Cache()`.
3. **Eventually** untouched lines are automatically reset to normal. Reliance on automatic reset is strongly discouraged because of the undetermined length of time required for automatic reset to occur.
