# 6.2.8.7.5.1. Graph Update Limitations

###### 6.2.8.7.5.1. Graph Update Limitations[](#graph-update-limitations "Permalink to this headline")

Kernel nodes:

* The owning context of the function cannot change.
* A node whose function originally did not use CUDA dynamic parallelism cannot be updated to a function which uses CUDA dynamic parallelism.

`cudaMemset` and `cudaMemcpy` nodes:

* The CUDA device(s) to which the operand(s) was allocated/mapped cannot change.
* The source/destination memory must be allocated from the same context as the original source/destination memory.
* Only 1D `cudaMemset`/`cudaMemcpy` nodes can be changed.

Additional memcpy node restrictions:

* Changing either the source or destination memory type (i.e., `cudaPitchedPtr`, `cudaArray_t`, etc.), or the type of transfer (i.e., `cudaMemcpyKind`) is not supported.

External semaphore wait nodes and record nodes:

* Changing the number of semaphores is not supported.

Conditional nodes:

* The order of handle creation and assignment must match between the graphs.
* Changing node parameters is not supported (i.e. number of graphs in the conditional, node context, etc).
* Changing parameters of nodes within the conditional body graph is subject to the rules above.

Memory nodes:

* It is not possible to update a `cudaGraphExec_t` with a `cudaGraph_t` if the `cudaGraph_t` is currently instantiated as a different `cudaGraphExec_t`.

There are no restrictions on updates to host nodes, event record nodes, or event wait nodes.
