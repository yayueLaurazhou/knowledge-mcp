###### 6.2.8.7.7.1. Device Graph Creation[](#device-graph-creation "Permalink to this headline")

In order for a graph to be launched from the device, it must be instantiated explicitly for device launch. This is achieved by passing the `cudaGraphInstantiateFlagDeviceLaunch` flag to the `cudaGraphInstantiate()` call. As is the case for host graphs, device graph structure is fixed at time of instantiation and cannot be updated without re-instantiation, and instantiation can only be performed on the host. In order for a graph to be able to be instantiated for device launch, it must adhere to various requirements.
