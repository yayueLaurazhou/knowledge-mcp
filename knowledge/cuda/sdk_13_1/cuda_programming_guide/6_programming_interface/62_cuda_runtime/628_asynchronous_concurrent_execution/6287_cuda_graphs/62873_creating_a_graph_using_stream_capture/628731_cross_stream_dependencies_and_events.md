# 6.2.8.7.3.1. Cross-stream Dependencies and Events

###### 6.2.8.7.3.1. Cross-stream Dependencies and Events[](#cross-stream-dependencies-and-events "Permalink to this headline")

Stream capture can handle cross-stream dependencies expressed with `cudaEventRecord()` and `cudaStreamWaitEvent()`, provided the event being waited upon was recorded into the same capture graph.

When an event is recorded in a stream that is in capture mode, it results in a *captured event.* A captured event represents a set of nodes in a capture graph.

When a captured event is waited on by a stream, it places the stream in capture mode if it is not already, and the next item in the stream will have additional dependencies on the nodes in the captured event. The two streams are then being captured to the same capture graph.

When cross-stream dependencies are present in stream capture, `cudaStreamEndCapture()` must still be called in the same stream where `cudaStreamBeginCapture()` was called; this is the *origin stream*. Any other streams which are being captured to the same capture graph, due to event-based dependencies, must also be joined back to the origin stream. This is illustrated below. All streams being captured to the same capture graph are taken out of capture mode upon `cudaStreamEndCapture()`. Failure to rejoin to the origin stream will result in failure of the overall capture operation.

```
// stream1 is the origin stream
cudaStreamBeginCapture(stream1);

kernel_A<<< ..., stream1 >>>(...);

// Fork into stream2
cudaEventRecord(event1, stream1);
cudaStreamWaitEvent(stream2, event1);

kernel_B<<< ..., stream1 >>>(...);
kernel_C<<< ..., stream2 >>>(...);

// Join stream2 back to origin stream (stream1)
cudaEventRecord(event2, stream2);
cudaStreamWaitEvent(stream1, event2);

kernel_D<<< ..., stream1 >>>(...);

// End capture in the origin stream
cudaStreamEndCapture(stream1, &graph);

// stream1 and stream2 no longer in capture mode
```

Graph returned by the above code is shown in [Figure 14](#creating-a-graph-using-api-fig-creating-using-graph-apis).

Note

When a stream is taken out of capture mode, the next non-captured item in the stream (if any) will still have a dependency on the most recent prior non-captured item, despite intermediate items having been removed.
