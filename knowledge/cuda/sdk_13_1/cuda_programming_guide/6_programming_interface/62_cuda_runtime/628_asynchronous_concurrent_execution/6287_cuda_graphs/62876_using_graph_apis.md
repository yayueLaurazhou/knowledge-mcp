`cudaGraph_t` objects are not thread-safe. It is the responsibility of the user to ensure that multiple threads do not concurrently access the same `cudaGraph_t`.

A `cudaGraphExec_t` cannot run concurrently with itself. A launch of a `cudaGraphExec_t` will be ordered after previous launches of the same executable graph.

Graph execution is done in streams for ordering with other asynchronous work. However, the stream is for ordering only; it does not constrain the internal parallelism of the graph, nor does it affect where graph nodes execute.
