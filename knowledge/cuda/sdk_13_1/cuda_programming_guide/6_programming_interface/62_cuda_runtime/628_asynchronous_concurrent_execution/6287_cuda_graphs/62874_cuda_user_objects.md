# 6.2.8.7.4. CUDA User Objects

##### 6.2.8.7.4. CUDA User Objects[](#cuda-user-objects "Permalink to this headline")

CUDA User Objects can be used to help manage the lifetime of resources used by asynchronous work in CUDA. In particular, this feature is useful for [CUDA Graphs](#cuda-graphs) and [stream capture](#creating-a-graph-using-stream-capture).

Various resource management schemes are not compatible with CUDA graphs. Consider for example an event-based pool or a synchronous-create, asynchronous-destroy scheme.

```
// Library API with pool allocation
void libraryWork(cudaStream_t stream) {
    auto &resource = pool.claimTemporaryResource();
    resource.waitOnReadyEventInStream(stream);
    launchWork(stream, resource);
    resource.recordReadyEvent(stream);
}
```

```
// Library API with asynchronous resource deletion
void libraryWork(cudaStream_t stream) {
    Resource *resource = new Resource(...);
    launchWork(stream, resource);
    cudaLaunchHostFunc(
        stream,
        [](void *resource) {
            delete static_cast<Resource *>(resource);
        },
        resource,
        0);
    // Error handling considerations not shown
}
```

These schemes are difficult with CUDA graphs because of the non-fixed pointer or handle for the resource which requires indirection or graph update, and the synchronous CPU code needed each time the work is submitted. They also do not work with stream capture if these considerations are hidden from the caller of the library, and because of use of disallowed APIs during capture. Various solutions exist such as exposing the resource to the caller. CUDA user objects present another approach.

A CUDA user object associates a user-specified destructor callback with an internal refcount, similar to C++ `shared_ptr`. References may be owned by user code on the CPU and by CUDA graphs. Note that for user-owned references, unlike C++ smart pointers, there is no object representing the reference; users must track user-owned references manually. A typical use case would be to immediately move the sole user-owned reference to a CUDA graph after the user object is created.

When a reference is associated to a CUDA graph, CUDA will manage the graph operations automatically. A cloned `cudaGraph_t` retains a copy of every reference owned by the source `cudaGraph_t`, with the same multiplicity. An instantiated `cudaGraphExec_t` retains a copy of every reference in the source `cudaGraph_t`. When a `cudaGraphExec_t` is destroyed without being synchronized, the references are retained until the execution is completed.

Here is an example use.

```
cudaGraph_t graph;  // Preexisting graph

Object *object = new Object;  // C++ object with possibly nontrivial destructor
cudaUserObject_t cuObject;
cudaUserObjectCreate(
    &cuObject,
    object,  // Here we use a CUDA-provided template wrapper for this API,
             // which supplies a callback to delete the C++ object pointer
    1,  // Initial refcount
    cudaUserObjectNoDestructorSync  // Acknowledge that the callback cannot be
                                    // waited on via CUDA
);
cudaGraphRetainUserObject(
    graph,
    cuObject,
    1,  // Number of references
    cudaGraphUserObjectMove  // Transfer a reference owned by the caller (do
                             // not modify the total reference count)
);
// No more references owned by this thread; no need to call release API
cudaGraphExec_t graphExec;
cudaGraphInstantiate(&graphExec, graph, nullptr, nullptr, 0);  // Will retain a
                                                               // new reference
cudaGraphDestroy(graph);  // graphExec still owns a reference
cudaGraphLaunch(graphExec, 0);  // Async launch has access to the user objects
cudaGraphExecDestroy(graphExec);  // Launch is not synchronized; the release
                                  // will be deferred if needed
cudaStreamSynchronize(0);  // After the launch is synchronized, the remaining
                           // reference is released and the destructor will
                           // execute. Note this happens asynchronously.
// If the destructor callback had signaled a synchronization object, it would
// be safe to wait on it at this point.
```

References owned by graphs in child graph nodes are associated to the child graphs, not the parents. If a child graph is updated or deleted, the references change accordingly. If an executable graph or child graph is updated with `cudaGraphExecUpdate` or `cudaGraphExecChildGraphNodeSetParams`, the references in the new source graph are cloned and replace the references in the target graph. In either case, if previous launches are not synchronized, any references which would be released are held until the launches have finished executing.

There is not currently a mechanism to wait on user object destructors via a CUDA API. Users may signal a synchronization object manually from the destructor code. In addition, it is not legal to call CUDA APIs from the destructor, similar to the restriction on `cudaLaunchHostFunc`. This is to avoid blocking a CUDA internal shared thread and preventing forward progress. It is legal to signal another thread to perform an API call, if the dependency is one way and the thread doing the call cannot block forward progress of CUDA work.

User objects are created with `cudaUserObjectCreate`, which is a good starting point to browse related APIs.
