###### 6.2.8.7.7.1.2. Device Graph Upload[](#device-graph-upload "Permalink to this headline")

In order to launch a graph on the device, it must first be uploaded to the device to populate the necessary device resources. This can be achieved in one of two ways.

Firstly, the graph can be uploaded explicitly, either via `cudaGraphUpload()` or by requesting an upload as part of instantiation via `cudaGraphInstantiateWithParams()`.

Alternatively, the graph can first be launched from the host, which will perform this upload step implicitly as part of the launch.

Examples of all three methods can be seen below:

```
// Explicit upload after instantiation
cudaGraphInstantiate(&deviceGraphExec1, deviceGraph1, cudaGraphInstantiateFlagDeviceLaunch);
cudaGraphUpload(deviceGraphExec1, stream);

// Explicit upload as part of instantiation
cudaGraphInstantiateParams instantiateParams = {0};
instantiateParams.flags = cudaGraphInstantiateFlagDeviceLaunch | cudaGraphInstantiateFlagUpload;
instantiateParams.uploadStream = stream;
cudaGraphInstantiateWithParams(&deviceGraphExec2, deviceGraph2, &instantiateParams);

// Implicit upload via host launch
cudaGraphInstantiate(&deviceGraphExec3, deviceGraph3, cudaGraphInstantiateFlagDeviceLaunch);
cudaGraphLaunch(deviceGraphExec3, stream);
```
