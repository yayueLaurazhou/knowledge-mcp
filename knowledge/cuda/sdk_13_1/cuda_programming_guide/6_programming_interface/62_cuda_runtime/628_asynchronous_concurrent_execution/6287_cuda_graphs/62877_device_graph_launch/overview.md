# 6.2.8.7.7. Device Graph Launch

##### 6.2.8.7.7. Device Graph Launch[](#device-graph-launch "Permalink to this headline")

There are many workflows which need to make data-dependent decisions during runtime and execute different operations depending on those decisions. Rather than offloading this decision-making process to the host, which may require a round-trip from the device, users may prefer to perform it on the device. To that end, CUDA provides a mechanism to launch graphs from the device.

Device graph launch provides a convenient way to perform dynamic control flow from the device, be it something as simple as a loop or as complex as a device-side work scheduler. This functionality is only available on systems which support [unified addressing](#unified-virtual-address-space).

Graphs which can be launched from the device will henceforth be referred to as device graphs, and graphs which cannot be launched from the device will be referred to as host graphs.

Device graphs can be launched from both the host and device, whereas host graphs can only be launched from the host. Unlike host launches, launching a device graph from the device while a previous launch of the graph is running will result in an error, returning `cudaErrorInvalidValue`; therefore, a device graph cannot be launched twice from the device at the same time. Launching a device graph from the host and device simultaneously will result in undefined behavior.
