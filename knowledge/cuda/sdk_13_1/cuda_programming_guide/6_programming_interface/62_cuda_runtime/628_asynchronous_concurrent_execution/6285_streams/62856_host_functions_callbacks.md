# 6.2.8.5.6. Host Functions (Callbacks)

##### 6.2.8.5.6. Host Functions (Callbacks)[](#host-functions-callbacks "Permalink to this headline")

The runtime provides a way to insert a CPU function call at any point into a stream via `cudaLaunchHostFunc()`. The provided function is executed on the host once all commands issued to the stream before the callback have completed.

The following code sample adds the host function `MyCallback` to each of two streams after issuing a host-to-device memory copy, a kernel launch and a device-to-host memory copy into each stream. The function will begin execution on the host after each of the device-to-host memory copies completes.

```
void CUDART_CB MyCallback(void *data){
    printf("Inside callback %d\n", (size_t)data);
}
...
for (size_t i = 0; i < 2; ++i) {
    cudaMemcpyAsync(devPtrIn[i], hostPtr[i], size, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice, stream[i]);
    MyKernel<<<100, 512, 0, stream[i]>>>(devPtrOut[i], devPtrIn[i], size);
    cudaMemcpyAsync(hostPtr[i], devPtrOut[i], size, cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost, stream[i]);
    cudaLaunchHostFunc(stream[i], MyCallback, (void*)i);
}
```

The commands that are issued in a stream after a host function do not start executing before the function has completed.

A host function enqueued into a stream must not make CUDA API calls (directly or indirectly), as it might end up waiting on itself if it makes such a call leading to a deadlock.
