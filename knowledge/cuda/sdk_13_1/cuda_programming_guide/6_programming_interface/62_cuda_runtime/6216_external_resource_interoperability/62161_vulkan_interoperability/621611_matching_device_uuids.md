# 6.2.16.1.1. Matching device UUIDs

##### 6.2.16.1.1. Matching device UUIDs[](#matching-device-uuids "Permalink to this headline")

When importing memory and synchronization objects exported by Vulkan, they must be imported and mapped on the same device as they were created on. The CUDA device that corresponds to the Vulkan physical device on which the objects were created can be determined by comparing the UUID of a CUDA device with that of the Vulkan physical device, as shown in the following code sample. Note that the Vulkan physical device should not be part of a device group that contains more than one Vulkan physical device. The device group as returned by `vkEnumeratePhysicalDeviceGroups` that contains the given Vulkan physical device must have a physical device count of 1.

```
int getCudaDeviceForVulkanPhysicalDevice(VkPhysicalDevice vkPhysicalDevice) {
    VkPhysicalDeviceIDProperties vkPhysicalDeviceIDProperties = {};
    vkPhysicalDeviceIDProperties.sType = VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_ID_PROPERTIES;
    vkPhysicalDeviceIDProperties.pNext = NULL;

    VkPhysicalDeviceProperties2 vkPhysicalDeviceProperties2 = {};
    vkPhysicalDeviceProperties2.sType = VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_PROPERTIES_2;
    vkPhysicalDeviceProperties2.pNext = &vkPhysicalDeviceIDProperties;

    vkGetPhysicalDeviceProperties2(vkPhysicalDevice, &vkPhysicalDeviceProperties2);

    int cudaDeviceCount;
    cudaGetDeviceCount(&cudaDeviceCount);

    for (int cudaDevice = 0; cudaDevice < cudaDeviceCount; cudaDevice++) {
        cudaDeviceProp deviceProp;
        cudaGetDeviceProperties(&deviceProp, cudaDevice);
        if (!memcmp(&deviceProp.uuid, vkPhysicalDeviceIDProperties.deviceUUID, VK_UUID_SIZE)) {
            return cudaDevice;
        }
    }
    return cudaInvalidDeviceId;
}
```
