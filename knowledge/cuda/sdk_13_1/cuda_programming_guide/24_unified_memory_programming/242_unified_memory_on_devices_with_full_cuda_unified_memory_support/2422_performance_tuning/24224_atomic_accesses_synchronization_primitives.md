# 24.2.2.4. Atomic accesses & synchronization primitives

#### 24.2.2.4. Atomic accesses & synchronization primitives[](#atomic-accesses-synchronization-primitives "Permalink to this headline")

CUDA Unified Memory supports all atomic operations available to host and device threads,
enabling all threads to cooperate by concurrently accessing the same shared memory location.
The [CUDA C++ standard library](https://nvidia.github.io/cccl/libcudacxx/extended_api/synchronization_primitives.html)
provides many heterogeneous synchronization primitives tuned for concurrent use between host and device threads,
including `cuda::atomic`, `cuda::atomic_ref`, `cuda::barrier`, `cuda::semaphore`, among many others.

On systems without [CPU and GPU page tables: hardware coherency vs. software coherency](#um-hw-coherency),
atomic accesses from the device to file-backed host memory are not supported.
The following example code is valid on systems with [CPU and GPU page tables: hardware coherency vs. software coherency](#um-hw-coherency)
but exhibits undefined behavior on other systems:

```
#include <cuda/atomic>

#include <cstdio>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <sys/mman.h>

#define ERR(msg, ...) { fprintf(stderr, msg, ##__VA_ARGS__); return EXIT_FAILURE; }

__global__ void kernel(int* ptr) {
  cuda::atomic_ref{*ptr}.store(2);
}

int main() {
  // this will be closed/deleted by default on exit
  FILE* tmp_file = tmpfile64();
  // need to allocate space in the file, we do this with posix_fallocate here
  int status = posix_fallocate(fileno(tmp_file), 0, 4096);
  if (status != 0) ERR("Failed to allocate space in temp file\n");
  int* ptr = (int*)mmap(NULL, 4096, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE, fileno(tmp_file), 0);
  if (ptr == MAP_FAILED) ERR("Failed to map temp file\n");

  // initialize the value in our file-backed memory
  *ptr = 1;
  printf("Atom value: %d\n", *ptr);

  // device and host thread access ptr concurrently, using cuda::atomic_ref
  kernel<<<1, 1>>>(ptr);
  while (cuda::atomic_ref{*ptr}.load() != 2);
  // this will always be 2
  printf("Atom value: %d\n", *ptr);

  return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```

On systems without [CPU and GPU page tables: hardware coherency vs. software coherency](#um-hw-coherency),
atomic accesses to unified memory may incur page faults which can lead to significant latencies.
Note that this is not the case for all GPU atomics to CPU memory on these systems:
operations listed by `nvidia-smi -q | grep "Atomic Caps Outbound"` may avoid page faults.

On systems with [CPU and GPU page tables: hardware coherency vs. software coherency](#um-hw-coherency),
atomics between host and device do not require page faults,
but may still fault for other reasons that any memory access can fault for.
